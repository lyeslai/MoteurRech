CITY SKETCHES


    _Go forth now, moods and metres,
    Sing your song and tell your story;
    You have companioned me
    Through hours grave and gay,
    What will you say
    To him whose curious hand
    Shall turn these pages?_

    _Soon all my joy in setting forth
    My vagrant thoughts
    Shall pass
    Into the silence;
    Soon I shall be
    One with the mystery._

    _My book upon some quiet shelf
    Beneath your touch
    Shall wake, perhaps,
    And speak again
    My wonder, my delight,
    My questioning before the night--_

    _And as you read
    Somewhere afar
    I shall be singing, singing._




_THE BARBER SHOP_


    I spend my life in a warren of worried men.
    In and out and to and fro
    And up and down in electric elevators
    They rush about and speak each other,
    Hurrying on to finish the deal,
    Hurrying home to wash and eat and sleep,
    Hurrying to love a little maybe
    Between the dark and dawn
    Or cuddle a tired child
    Who blinks to see his father.

    I hurry too but with a sense
    That Life is hurrying faster
    And will catch up with me.

    Right in the middle of our furious activity
    Two soft-voiced barbers in a little room,
    White-tiled and fresh and smelling deliciously,
    Flourish their glittering tools
    And smile and barb
    And talk about the war and stocks and the Honolulu earthquake
    With equal impartiality.

    I like to go there.
    Time seems slow and patient
    While they tuck me up in white
    And hover over me.
    The room gives north and west and the sunset sky
    Lights the grey river to a ribbon of glory
    Where silhouetted tugs
    Like tooting beetles fuss about their smoky businesses;

    Besides, in that high place
    No curious passer-by
    Can see my ignominious bald spot treated with a tonic,
    Nor can a lady stop and bow to me, my chin in lather,
    As happened once;
    So I go there often
    And even take a book.

    There’s another person all in white
    Who comes and goes and manicures your nails
    On application.
    One can read with one hand while she does the other.
    Because I feel that Life is hurrying me along
    With horrid haste
    Soon to desert me utterly,
    I used to take my Inferno in my pocket
    And reflect on what might happen
    Were I among the usurers.

    One day a low-pitched voice broke in.
    I listened vaguely,
    What was the woman saying?
    “Please listen for a moment, Mister Brown,
    I’ve done your nails for almost half a year
    You’ve never looked at me.”
    I looked at that,
    And sure enough the girl was young and round and sweet.
    She coloured as I turned to her
    And looked away.
    I waited silently, enjoying her confusion.
    The words had been shot out at me
    And now apparently she wished them back.
    “What do you want?” I said.
    Again a silence while she rubbed away.
    I opened my Inferno with an ironic glance
    Towards Paradiso waiting just beyond.
    “Well, rub away, my girl,” I thought,
    “You opened up, go on.”

    The book provoked her.
    “I’m straight,” she said.
    “I never talked like this before.
    The fellows that come round--
    Good Lord!
    Showin’ me two pink ticket corners
    Stickin’ out the pocket of their vest,
    ‘Say, kid,--tonight,--you know,’
    Thinkin’ I’ll tumble
    For a ticket to a show!
    They make me sick, they do,
    Boobs like that;
    You’re different. I want to know
    What’s in that book you read.
    I want to hear you talk.
    Oh, Mister, I’m so lonesome!
    But I’m straight, I tell you.
    I read, too, every evening in my room,
    But I can’t ever find
    The books you have.
    I expect you think I’m horrid
    To talk like this--but--
    I got some things by an Englishman
    From the Public Library.
    Say, they were queer!
    He thinks a woman has a right
    To say out if she likes a man;
    He thinks they do the looking
    Because they want--
    Oh, Mister, I’m so terribly ashamed
    I’ll die when I get home,
    An’ yet I had to speak--
    I’d be awful, awful good to you, if only,
    Please, please, don’t think I’m like--
    Don’t think I’m one o’ them!
    Whatever you say, don’t, don’t think that!”

    She stopped, and turned to hide her crying.
    I looked at her again,
    Looked at her young wet eyes,
    At her abashed bent head,
    Looked at her sweet, deft hands
    Busy with mine....

    But--
    Not for nothing
    Were my grandfather and four of my uncles
    Elders in the Sixth Presbyterian Church
    Situated on the Avenue.
    Oh not for nothing
    Was I led
    To squirm on those green rep seats
    One day in seven.

    And now,
    The white-tiled, sweetly-smelling barber shop
    Is lost to me.
    What a pity!




_LOVE IN THE LOOP_


    They sat by the fountain at a table for two,
    The traditional couple--
    An awkward, ill-dressed girl,
    With a lovely skin and a country smile,
    And the man who was paying for her dinner.
    There they were--
    Exploiter and Exploited.

    I could see only his back, clad in grey tweed.
    His neck rolled over his collar
    In a thick red fold,
    And his hands, which he waved about,
    Were fat and white with shiny nails
    And diamond rings.

    I wondered if he was offering her better clothes
    For the girl looked troubled.
    Her shirt-waist wasn’t fresh,
    Her skirt was draggled,
    And her feet, curled up under the chair,
    Shifted themselves uneasily, seeking cover
    For most lamentable shoes;
    But oh, her skin!

    Soft rose and the delicate white of summer mist.
    Her hair was the brown of hazelnuts after a frost,
    Glinting to saffron as she turned her head
    Quickly from side to side
    Like an enquiring dove.

    Soon oysters came;
    She eyed them with distrust,
    Then ate one thoughtfully and made a face.
    He seemed concerned
    And beckoned the waiter to remove the dish,
    Asking if she’d rather have a “country sausage.”
    She showed her baby teeth in a happy smile
    And sausages were brought.
    She ate them all while he watched her enviously,
    Putting a little white pellet in some water
    For his second course.

    Champagne was set before them and he filled her glass
    While he turned his bottom side up.
    She sipped, and made another face, and choked,
    Then tried again and laughed.
    “I do believe it’s good,” she said,
    And finished the glass,
    Holding it out for more.
    “You’d best look out,” I heard him say
    As he slid his hand along the table-cloth.
    She cringed away.
    “Oh, please, please don’t!” she said;
    But he hitched his chair softly around the table.

    I watched it all,
    Wondering miserably if it was my duty
    To warn the girl,
    And whether she would prove clinging if I did.

    Finally to secure her hands he turned himself.
    My God, what a mug!
    His beady eyes over his glistening cheeks
    Blinked like a hurrying pig’s:
    His protuberent lips wiggled themselves
    In amourous expectancy
    While little beads of ecstasy bedewed his brow.
    I turned my chair around and raised my paper.

    Suddenly I heard her cry, “Oh, Mister!
    That fuzzy stuff you made me drink--my head!”
    And she grabbed her coat and slithered along the floor
    To the front door, calling over her shoulder.
    “Don’t come. I want some air,
    I’ll be back in a minute or two.”

    After a startled forward step
    He settled back and called the waiter,
    Who hurried to busy himself expectantly
    With the inevitable reckoning.
    By the time it was ready, Mr. Amourous-One
    Was deep in the stock reports and dead to the world.
    The waiter stood on one foot and then on the other,
    Finally wandering off.

    After some twenty minutes of troubled scrutiny
    The paper was laid down,
    And Mr. Amourous
    Looked at his watch and jumped,
    Then turned the bill and burrowed in his pocket,
    Pulling out change.
    Next came a leather wallet--
    And then what a bellowing rent the astonished air!

    “Eight hundred dollars gone!” he yelled.
    “Hi! get that girl, I tell you, GET THAT GIRL!”
    But nobody stirred.
    Exploiter and Exploited--




_CONVERSE_


    They were two disembodied heads on bath cabinets,
    Just like “Une tête de femme” by Rodin, in a show,
    Save that each head was topped
    By a ruffled rubber cap,
    One rose-lined grey, one brown.
    They were two female heads,
    And yet they were not pretty,
    At least not then.

    They fixed their level-fronting eyes on a sanitary wall
    In front of them
    And waited.
    The Bath Attendant turned a crank,
    Consulted a thermometer, and vanished.

    Time draggled warmly by.

    Finally one head heaved a heavy sigh and turned itself
    And looked at the other head,
    Which bit its lip and frowned.

    Since names seem meaningless
    When souls converse,
    Let us call these souls quite simply Grey and Brown.
    The one that heaved and turned itself was Brown;
    The one that bit its lip was Grey.

    “Are you pretending that you didn’t see me?”
    Queried Brown.
    “Oh no!” said Grey.

    “I’ve been meaning to have a talk with you,” said Brown.
    “And why not now?”
    “And why not now?” said Grey.

    “You may as well understand,” continued Brown,
    “You’ve got to give him up.”
    “Him up?” said Grey.

    “That’s what I said,” said Brown.
    “You very well know
    His duty is to me. I bear his name,
    I’ve given him seven children and a step,
    All likely boys.
    He’s very fond of them, you know.”
    “I know,” said Grey.

    “Well, what have you got to say?” Brown trembled on.
    “Why don’t you speak?”
    Grey murmured softly,
    “Isn’t it hot in these?”

    Brown looked at her and laughed.
    “You’re pretty cool,” she said,
    “But I’d like to tell you here and straight and now,
    I’m tired of nonsense,
    Tired of worrying,
    And very, very tired of him and you.”
    “Of him and me,” said Grey.

    “I’ve cried and then I’ve laughed
    And said I didn’t care,”
    Said whimpering Brown.
    “I’ve dressed myself up beautifully
    And then again I’d slump,”
    Said sniffling Brown.
    “But nothing mattered.
    If he came home bright and gay, of course I’d know
    He’d been with you,
    And if he came home different, then I’d know
    He wished he were,
    So gradually it didn’t matter much
    Which way he was.
    And then I thought I’d try and keep
    The boys from knowing,
    So I’d make up lies and plan;
    With seven and the step
    It took considerable planning,
    But luckily the little ones don’t notice.
    And now I’ve got you here, I’m going to have my say!”
    “Your say,” said Grey.

    “I’m going to get your promise here and now
    To give him up for good,
    Do you understand?”
    “For good,” said Grey.
    “Oh yes, I understand.”

    “Or else,” and beetling Brown
    Grew dark and terrible,
    “You’ll be the co-respondent in a suit!”
    “A suit,” said Grey.

    “I said a suit,” said Brown,
    “I mean a suit.
    Moreover, as you haven’t said a word
    I’ll bring it soon.”
    “It soon,” said Grey.

    And then the Attendant came,
    Looked at the clock and then the thermometer,
    Got sheets and led them out.

    “Unless--” said Brown.
    “Oh yes, unless--” said Grey.




_WINDOW-WISHING_


    Oh yes, we get off regular
    By half past six,
    And six on Saturdays.
    Sister an’ I go marketing on Saturday nights,
    Everything’s down.
    Besides there’s Sunday comin’;
    You can sleep,
    Oh my, how you can sleep!
    No mother shakin’ you
    To “get up now,”
    No coffee smell
    Hurryin’ you while you dress,
    No Beauty Shop to get to on the tick of the minute
    Or pony up a fine.
    Sister an’ I go window-wishin’
    Sunday afternoon, all over the Loop.
    It’s lots of fun.
    First she’ll choose what she thinks is the prettiest
    Then my turn comes.
    You mustn’t ever choose a thing
    The other’s lookin’ at,
    And when a window’s done
    The one that beats
    Can choose the first time when we start the next.
    The hats are hardest
    ’Specially when they’re turnin’ round and round.
    But window-wishin’s great!

    Then there’s the pictures,
    Bully ones sometimes,
    Sometimes they’re queer.
    Sister an’ I go in ’most every Sunday.
    We took Mother ’long last week,
    But she didn’t like ’em any too well.
    Mother’s old, you know,
    We have to kinda humour her.
    Next day she couldn’t remember a single thing
    But the lions on the steps.

    You know what happened the other night?
    Sister and I didn’t know just what to do,--
    A gentleman came to see us.
    He said Jim asked him to
    Sometime when he was near.
    Jim’s my brother, you know.
    He lives down state.
    We have to send him part of our wages regular,
    Sister an’ I;
    He doesn’t seem to get a steady place,
    And Mother likes us to.
    She’s dotty on Jim.
    Sometimes I get real nasty--
    A great big man like that!
    Anyway his friend came walkin’ in
    And said Jim sent his love.
    Sister an’ I didn’t exactly know what to do,
    And Mother looked so queer!
    Her dress was awful dirty.
    He said he was livin’ in Chicago,
    And Sister said she hoped
    He had a place he liked.
    He only stayed a little while,
    Till half past eight,
    And then he took his hat
    From under the chair he was sittin’ on
    And went away.
    I said just now it happened the other night,
    But it was seven weeks ago last Friday evening.
    He said he’d come again.
    I dunno as he will,
    Sister an’ I keep wonderin’.
    We dressed up-every night for quite a while
    And stayed in Sundays.
    Yesterday we thought
    We’d go down window-wishin’
    And what do you think?
    Just as she’d picked a lovely silver dress
    Sister jerked my arm,
    Then all of a sudden there she was
    Cryin’ and snifflin’ in her handkerchief
    Standin’ there on the sidewalk,
    And what do you think she said?
    “I’d like to kill the woman that wears that gown!”
    I tell you I was scared,
    She looked so queer,
    But she’s all right today.
    Oh thank you, two o’clock next Saturday the tenth?
    I’ll put it down,
    A shampoo and a wave, you said?
    I’ll keep the time,
    Good-morning.




_A LITTLE OLD WOMAN_


    There’s a twinkling little old woman
    Brings me sandwiches after my Turkish bath.
    Her cheeks are brown and pink,
    And her eyes, behind her gold-bowed spectacles,
    Smile in a curious fashion as if to say
    “I know you’re worried about that letter in the pocket of your dress,
    Hanging out there, but I’ll take care of it.”

    She sets the tray down on a chair beside my couch
    And trots away to another languid lady in a sheet,
    And as I fall asleep she says to me
    “Don’t worry honey, I’ll take care of it.”
    Perhaps it’s only in my dreams she says it,
    But anyway she’s there.

    Once after she had hooked me up
    She raised her sober dress
    To show me that she too could wear a lace-trimmed petticoat;
    And a dainty thing it was, with tiny rosebuds
    Festooned all around.
    She dropped her skirt and laughed.
    “I’ve got one ... too,” she said.
    This was uncanny, so I said Good-day.

    Next time I went I met him at the door
    With a market basket!
    It seems he brought the dainties every day
    She made up into sandwiches for us who lolled about.
    I took a look at him,--
    A delicate, chiselled face with soft blue eyes,
    Under his chin from ear to ear a fringe of yellow down,
    Around a bald spot, curls of whity-gold;
    He blinked a little as she gave him charges
    Then wandered thoughtfully away
    Clutching his basket.
    He wore a black frock coat too big for him,
    And on his head, a round black hat like a French Curé’s.

    So that was why she wore the petticoat
    And smiled so knowingly--
    But how she worked!
    I wouldn’t work like that.
    Perhaps she kept that little thing for pleasuring.
    Well, this is a woman’s world, why not,
    If so be that he pleased her?

    The steamy, scented atmosphere that day
    Seemed teeming with intrigue;
    I looked at the strapping, bare-legged wench
    Who brought my sheet
    Enquiring mutely, “Have you got a lover?”
    And when a person next me roused herself
    To ask the time,
    I thought, “Ah-ha! He’s waiting!”

    It chanced when sandwiches were brought
    I found myself alone
    With her of the spectacles and petticoat.
    I wanted to go to sleep,
    But I wanted more to find out how
    She got a lover,
    And how she kept him.

    After some skirmishing I asked straight out,
    “Was that your husband with the market basket?”
    “My husband’s dead,” she said, and grinned
    And took a chair beside my couch.
    “Who is he, then?” I said.
    “He’s mine,” she answered. “Mine!
    I paid for him five hundred dollars cool,
    And now he likes me!”

    I sat up at that.
    “You paid for him?” I gulped.
    “Why yes, he lived up-stairs, you know.
    His heart is bad; he hadn’t any cash;
    He got hauled up on a breach-of-promise suit;
    I paid it for him.
    Now he lives with me!”

    She emphasized her “me” triumphantly.
    I looked her over.
    Certainly there was something there of vividness,
    Of quick vitality.
    He and his funny hat and goldy curls--

    Well, anything may be.
    “Are you happy now?” I asked.
    She smiled and bridled.
    “The business pays,” she said.
    “You ladies pay good prices for your food
    And then the tips besides.
    He gets the things for me and brings ’em fresh,
    Then what do you suppose he does the rest of the time?
    (His heart is bad, you know)
    Writes verses all day long for the Sunday papers;
    Mostly they don’t get in,
    But every now and then he gets two dollars.
    I bought him an Underwood last week.
    He was so pleased,
    Only the punctuation isn’t right.
    It isn’t a second-hand; cost me a hundred and twenty-five;
    I saved it up--”

    The bell rang and she rose.
    “Say! please don’t tell them anything about--
    About--my husband.”
    And she vanished.

_DESIGN_


    If all the world’s a stage, why do we know
      Naught of the drama we the actors play?
    Are we but puppets, we who come and go
      Mumbling our parts through life’s quick-passing day?

    What if some master hand design the show
      Planning a spacious pattern cunningly!
    Time, color, drifting human shapes all go
      Into a great discordant harmony:

    Let this one’s part be cast in delicate grey,
      Let this a heavy purple shadow be,
    Here let there come one clear, cold, bluish ray
      And here--but hold! one actor suddenly

    In desperate rebellion cries his part--
    A scarlet tumult from his own hot heart.




_THE WORLD CRY_


        Joy, light, and love I crave
        And shall discover--
    Life’s wild adventure opening to my will:
        High thought and brave,
        The rapture of a lover,
    The Vision gleaming from yon western hill.

        Beyond my present sight
        There lies some sweet allure,
    Some crested glory waiting to be won;
        Shimmering in light,
        Beautiful and sure,
    Beckoning bright hands that call me on.

        I know not where it lies,
        Nor whither I go, nor how
    The way is paved--with pleasure or with pain;
        But the search is in my eyes,
        And the dust upon my brow
    Shall turn to aureoled gold when I attain.

           *       *       *       *       *

    Oh, old old hope--
    Unfulfilled desire!
    Pitiful the faith,
    Beautiful the fire!

    Know, soul who criest,
    Thy gleaming from afar,
    Thy quest of wild adventure,
    Thy sweet far star

    Shall be the bitter path
    To a high stern goal;
    So bow thy head
    To thine own soul.




_BROWN SANDS_


    My stallion impatiently
      Stamps at my side,
    Into the desert far
      We two shall ride.

    Brown sands around us fly,
      Winds whistle free,
    The desert is sharing
      Gladness with me.

    The madness of motion
      Is mine again.
    Forgotten forever
      Sorrow and pain.

    Into the desert far
      Swiftly we flee,
    Knowing the passionate
      Joy of the free.




_SEEKING_


    Swift like the lark
    Out of the dark
      One cometh, singing;

    Silent in flight
    Out of the night
      Answer is winging.

    Forth to the dawn
    Leaps like a fawn
      A cry of high greeting,

    Into the sun
    Two that have run
      Seeking, are meeting.




_MAY 11, 1915_


    A prayer is forming on my tightened lips--
      Lord grant that I may keep my soul from hate!
    I have known love, I have been pitiful,
      Lord, I would keep my grief compassionate!

    Pain-maddened cries I hear from out the sea,
      Upstaring at me, faces of the dead;
    Those silent bodies seem to call aloud,
      Those silent souls are still and comforted.

    And we are here to bear the weight of pain--
      Oh, keep the poison from its awful task!
    Lord, let me be as they are ere I hate,
      Let me love on! this, this is what I ask!

    However long the way, there is a turning,
      Somewhere beyond the storm there lies a land
    Where Peace abides, where love shall live again,
      And men shall greet with friendly outstretched hand

    While little children laugh, and women weep
      With happiness--Oh, Lord, until that hour
    Keep Thou my hope, keep Thou my tenderness,
      Keep Thou my trust in Thy far-seeing power!




_WATCHERS_


    I watch the Eastern sky
    For a sign of dawn
    Long delayed.
    Such stillness is around
    That every separate sense
    Is twice-attuned, twice-powerful,
    And loneliness enwraps me like a sea
    Into whose unplumbed depths I must go down:
    A sea unsatisfied
    Where drifting shapes, wan-eyed,
    Reach forth wan arms
    Towards them who pause to look at their own souls
    Mirrored upon the sea.

    Somewhere a loon
    Sends forth its weary cry across the dark.
    Oh, wailing bird, I know, I know!
    I think tonight the soul of the world is desolate
    And you and I its watchers.

    Yet cease! oh cease!
    The night air quivers and resounds
    To bear your cry across the sleeping lake,
    And I would have your silence
    While I make
    My own complaint.

    For I would ask why we who have so little space
    To live and love and wonder
    Must go down into eternal mystery
    Alone:
    And I would know
    Why, since that awful loneliness must be,
    We go about as strangers here on earth
    And meet and laugh and mock and part again
    With never a look into each others’ eyes,
    With never a question of each others’ pain.

    So, even as I hear your melancholy plaint
    Across the sleeping lake,
    I send my questing cry across the world--
    And as I watch and listen,
    Through the stillness
    There comes to me an echoing and a far reverberation
    Of the many who have gone
    Into the limitless mystery,
    And thus they speak--

    “We too have known your questing,
    We too have stretched our arms forth to the night
    And clasped its nothingness,
    We too have lived and loved and wondered
    For a little space
    And then gone onward,
    And we seek across the silence
    To send our voices
    Out, out, across the dark.”

    Is it your voice I hear, oh far, strange bird,
    Or is it theirs--
    Theirs who have gone onward
    Alone and unafraid?
    Is there an answer I may sometime find,
    Or is it that our lips are dumb,
    Our eyes are blind,
    When love would come?

           *       *       *       *       *

    Now faint light comes upon the shadowy sky,
    The East is waking and the day begins.
    You send your cry across the quivering lake,
    I send my question out across the world,
    We watch, we two,
    Alone.




_TO MAURICE BROWNE_

(_On his creation of Capulchard in Cloyd Head’s “Grotesques.”_)


    Shadows are round me as the dawn breaks,
    Shadows with long white swaying arms
    And anguished faces.
    I see them meet and touch and part
    Crying their desire,
    While a bitter figure moulds them
    In a shifting decoration
    Which enchants, eludes and maddens,
    Imprisoning my dreams.

    Now they plead and droop and cower,
    Holding wan hands
    To whatever gods there be,
    Praying intercession
    From the malign enchantment
    Of their decorative doom
    Whence they weep their silent tears.

    Oh, Draughtsman terrible
    Who puts out the moon and stars,
    Who smiles and waves a hand
    And puppet hearts are broken,
    Let them love!
    Only a moment in a theater,
    Only a moment under the stars,
    All there may be before the end--
    Let them love!

           *       *       *       *       *

    The show is over.
    The swaying puppets of a little longer hour
    Go forth and cry out their desire
    To a Master of Decoration,--
    Their God unseen,
    And He, like you, smiles, puts forth a hand
    And blots the moon and stars
    And tears the glory from the earth and sky
    And cries:
    “Back to your places, fools!
    You shall not love!”




_PRAYERS_


    Day by day I tread my appointed way
    Greeting the sun with dutiful intent,
    Seeing his slow decline into the West,
    Watching draw near my night of quietude.

    Each day I see fade slowly back to join
    Those other days, unlived, unloved, unmourned,
    That have passed by in grave processional
    With never a golden one to mark their passing.

    Sometimes at night I ask the friendly stars
    “Tell me, what do I here? Why have I breath
    And this fair body in a world of shadows?
    Why do I live?”
    But the stars shine silently
    And make no answer.

    Sometimes I ask of God,
    “Dear Lord, I love Thee well
    But Thou art far away--
    Couldst Thou not send to me
    Someone on earth to love?
    So should I love Thee more.”
    But God sends no one.

    Sometimes I ask the far tumultuous sea,
    “Oh Sea, give me of your great beating heart!
    Let me be swept on the whirlwind,
    Let me be lulled and rocked,
    Let me be storm-tossed, made mad,
    Then--let me perish!”
    But the Sea roars on unheeding.

    So day by day I tread my appointed way
    Greeting the sun with dutiful intent,
    Seeing his slow decline into the West,
    Watching draw near my night of quietude.




_MY BOAT AND I_


    My staunch little boat is tugging at its moorings
    Eager to be free,
    Eager to slip out on the great waters
    Beyond the returning tides,
    Out to the unknown sea.

    My staunch little boat, unwilling prisoner,
    Frets and pulls at the anchor chain
    While the wind calls,
    “Come! come!
    I will bear you
    Out to the unknown sea!”

    Long time my boat and I have plied the harbour
    On little busy journeyings intent,
    Long time with wistful gazing
    I have listened to the calling--
    The winds with buffeting caress,
    The waves with ceaseless urge--
    Calling “Rest, rest, rest,
    Rest on an unknown sea.”

    And now we are away
    Into the mystery.
    Quietly the swaying waters
    Rock and beguile and soothe us
    That we may not know
    We are so far away.

    Along the shore
    Are hands stretched out.
    What would you with me now,
    Oh pleading hands?
    I come not to you any more,
    I have set my sail
    Out to the unknown sea,
    Would you have me stay adventuring?
    Would you have me come again
    To be amidst you
    With alien eyes and a heart unquiet?

    Oh cease your crying!
    I come not back.
    Long time my little boat and I
    Have fretted at the mooring,
    Long time we have looked out beyond the bar
    With a great questioning, and a great wonder,
    And then, an hour came which held the parting
    And we slipped
    Out, out, to the unknown sea.

           *       *       *       *       *

    The hands stretched out have faded from my sight,
    The shore is dim,
    The mountains fade into the limitless blue,
    Only the wind and the sea companion me,
    Singing
    “Rest, rest, rest,
    Rest on an unknown sea.”




_PICTURES_


    I saw a little boy go hurrying
    Towards an old man nodding in the sun.
    He tweaked him by the sleeve
    And gazed at him with insistent frowning eyes
    Asking his question.
    The old man blinked and muttered
    And the child let go his sleeve
    And drooped and turned away.

           *       *       *       *       *

    I saw a mother counselling her daughter
    About her lover, and the girl was sullen,
    Looking from out averted eyes
    For means to go to him;
    And the mother bowed her head
    And turned away.

           *       *       *       *       *

    I saw two lovers meet with hungry arms,
    And kiss and speak and kiss again--
    Then speak with challenging tones and fall apart.
    I saw them turn with tightened lips made dumb
    And eyes quick-quenched and dark.
    Slowly they went their ways.

           *       *       *       *       *

    I saw a woman kneeling in a church,
    Her head was bent upon worn hands
    Clasped tightly.
    Her dress was black and poor.
    After a time she rose and shook her head,
    Then beat her fist upon the rail
    And clattered noisily down the aisle.
    At the door she paused,
    Narrowed her eyes at the holy water
    And passed on.




_FORWARD, SINGING!_


    Listen, girl, stand there near me,
    Give me your two fluttering hands,
    Then listen.

    Little hurrying human beings
    Are important and significant
    Only in so far as they can stand alone.
    Most of them stand sideways,
    Propping themselves
    Against this brother or that brother
    Or this sister or that sister,
    Leaving each prop
    Only to carom swiftly to the next.

    Now shall not every one of these
    Sometime discover
    If his prop fall down
    He falls as well?

    Listen, beautiful child,
    I would carve my destiny alone!
    As a keen-eyed captain steers his ship
    By the light of the far north star
    Awake, alert, alone.

    So, laughing girl
    Whom I call to my side,
    Hear!
    I stand by myself.
    I can love, aye, with a fierce flame,
    But I love none so much, no man, no woman,
    That his passing or his forgetfulness
    Shall undo me.
    I and my soul
    Stand beyond the need of comforting.
    None has power to make me
    Helpless, incomplete, beholden.

    Now, bright child, golden girl,
    Warm woman with the fluttering hands
    Whom desire has brought,
    Will you come to my arms?
    I will give you love,
    No other lover can give you love like mine,
    Come!

    Ah, that is well:
    Quick, your mouth,
    And then forward, singing!

    But,--if you had not come,
    Laughing girl,
    I would have gone forward singing
    Alone!




_BARBERRIES_


    You say I touch the barberries
    As a lover his mistress?
    What a curious fancy!
    One must be delicate, you know,
    They have bitter thorns.
    You say my hand is hurt?
    Oh no, it was my breast,
    It was crushed and pressed--
    I mean--why yes, of course, of course--
    There is a bright drop, isn’t there?
    Right on my finger,
    Just the color of a barberry,
    But it comes from my heart.

    Do you love barberries?
    In the autumn
    When the sun’s desire
    Touches them to a glory of crimson and gold?
    I love them best then.
    There is something splendid about them;
    They are not afraid
    Of being warm and glad and bold,
    They flush joyously
    Like a cheek under a lover’s kiss,
    They bleed cruelly
    Like a dagger wound in the breast,
    They flame up madly for their little hour,
    Knowing they must die--
    Do you love barberries?




_TWO PATHS_


    Today it seemed God bent to me and said,
    “Pilgrim, you are weary, are you unaware
    You have two paths?”
    And I answered, wondering,
    “Tell me of them that I may choose.”
    And God said
    “You have set your face towards a far goal,
    To be attained
    Only with heartbreak of endeavor.
    It is written should you choose this path
    Many times you shall faint and falter,
    Raising yourself with bruised hands
    And bewildered eyes,
    And when at last
    You see the ending of the journey,
    Before eternal silence comes,
    You shall hear
    A little clamouring and tinkling of men’s voices:
    But you will smile quietly
    And turn away.”

    “And the other path?” I asked.
    In a different voice God said,
    “The other path is short,
    It ends but a little way ahead,
    There is no attainment, no acclaim;
    Only darkness, quiet,
    Rest from desire,
    And memory
    In the heart of the beloved.”

    And I answered,
    “I have chosen.”




_WHEN YOU COME_

 (“There was a girl with him for a time. She took him to her room when
 he was desolate and warmed him and took care of him. One day he could
 not find her. For many weeks he walked constantly in that locality in
 search of her.”--From Life of Francis Thompson.)


    When you come tonight
    To our small room
    You will look and listen--
    I shall not be there.

    You will cry out your dismay
    To the unheeding gods;
    You will wait and look and listen--
    I shall not be there.

    There is a part of you I love
    More than your hands in mine at rest;
    There is a part of you I love
    More than your lips upon my breast.

    There is a part of you I wound
    Even in my caress;
    There is a part of you withheld
    I may not possess.

    There is a part of you I hate--
    Your need of me
    When you would be alone,
    Alone and free.

    When you come tonight
    To our small room
    You will look and listen--
    I shall not be there.




_REST_


    Often I have listened curiously
    To the sound of a simple word
    All seemed to know,
    And wondered why I could not find
    Its meaning.

    Often I have dreamed
    Of that great Nothingness,
    That Silence which shall come,
    And asked if that
    Were rest.

    To the unquiet sea
    I have gone down
    Seeking companionship,
    Calling out to the beating waves
    “Do you too ask for rest?”

    Of the wind and the rain
    Singing their requiem
    Over dead summer
    I have asked,
    “You will be quiet soon;
    Where do you find rest?”

    To the white moon
    Sailing serenely
    I have said,
    “You are dim and old and cold;
    Have you found rest?”

    To the eternal sun
    Uprising solemnly
    I have cried out,
    “And this new day you bring,
    Will it hold my rest?”

    Once to my heart tumultuous
    There came a gleaming,
    A far prophecy that like a fairy benison descending
    Gave answer to my questioning--
    Strange message lit with wonderment--

    “Deep in the city’s labyrinthine heart
    There shall be moonlight for us and white song.”
    So ran the words,
    And like a diapason of sweet sound
    Across the stillness,
    Echoing, profound,
    There crept the promise,--rest.

    And then--you came.
    I turned to find your hand, your arms, your breast.
    Deep in the city’s labyrinthine heart
    You held me close, at rest.




_MORITURUS TE SALUTO_


    When one goes hence
    By his own hand alone
    We look aside.
    In a hushed tone
    We say--“What pain has gone before
    The sudden end?”

    But I shall go
    Because I know
    No longer can the earth
    Hold any other joy for me
    Like this.

    One night we had together,
    Only one.
    In all the years
    For all my tears
    The gods have given me
    Only one night,
    And it is over.

    Now I am glad to go
    Into the Silence.
    I have breathed the heights.
    I should but know
    The level ways and paths
    Of little valleys,
    I will not, this should be.

    So, Beloved,
    Remember
    It is because of happiness,
    Not sorrow,
    That I go.
    From the far coolness
    Of eternity
    I shall look out
    To the grave stars,
    Singing.




_FLASHLIGHTS_


    The winter dusk creeps up the Avenue
    With biting cold.
    Behind bright window panes
    In gauzy garments
    Waxen ladies smile
    As shirt-sleeved men
    Hustle them off their pedestals for the night.

    Along the Avenue
    A girl comes hurrying,
    Holding her shawl.
    She stops to look in at the window.
    “Oh Gee!” she says, “look at the chiffon muff!”
    A whimpering dog
    Falters up to cringe against her skirt.

    A man in his shirt sleeves lolls against a tree,
    His feet stick out,
    His hands lie on the grass, palms up.
    He stares ahead.
    Now and again he turns himself
    As from the enshrouding darkness forms emerge
    Dragging their feet, arms interlocked,
    Wan faces raised to the flare of light.
    Sometimes these kiss,
    Scream in brief laughter, or throw their bodies
    Prone on the welcoming earth.
    The man watches them, then turns his head,
    Gets himself upon his feet
    And walks away.

    Candles toppling sideways in tomato cans
    Sputter and sizzle at head and foot.
    The gaudy patterns of a patch-work quilt
    Lie smooth and straight
    Save where upswelling over a silent shape.
    A man in high boots stirs something on a rusty stove
    Round and round and round,
    As a new cry like a bleating lamb’s
    Pierces his brain.
    After a time the man busies himself
    With hammer and nails and rough-hewn lumber
    But fears to strike a blow.
    Outside the moonlight sleeps white upon the plain
    And the bark of a coyote shrills across the night.

    A woman rocking, rocking, rocking,
    A small hand waving, nestling:
    Outside, lights blurred to starriness
    And summer rain.

           *       *       *       *       *

    Little waves slap softly and monotonously
    Against the pier:
    A triangle of geese honk by;
    On the darkening sand
    Fresh lines traced with a stick--
    “I am sorry, Forgive,”
    And a little oblong mound with a cross of twigs.
    Near by a girl’s hat and dainty scarf.

    A smell of musk
    Comes to him pungently through the darkness.
    On the screen
    Scenes from foreign lands
    Released by the censor
    Shimmer in cool black and white
    Historic information.
    He shifts his seat sideways, sideways--
    A seeking hand creeps to another hand,
    And a leaping flame
    Illuminates the historic information.

    Within the room, sounds of weeping
    Low and hushed:
    Without, a man, beautiful with the beauty
    Of young strength,
    Holds pitifully to the handle of the door.
    He hiccoughs and turns away
    While a hand organ plays
    “The hours I spend with thee, dear heart.”

    A pink feather atop of a greying white straw hat,
    A peek-a-boo waist and skirt showing a line of stocking
    Above white shoes,
    Stand in front of a judge
    Who leans over a desk of golden oak
    And summons forward a sulky, slouching boy.
    “You are required by this Court,” says the judge,
    “To pay over to this woman
    One-third of your weekly wage
    For the support of your innocent child.”
    And the clerk of the court calls out
    “Next on the docket?”




_FLOODGATES_


THE MAN

    Dear, try to understand.
    I wish that you could see,
    Now I am free
    Of all the fret and torment,
    The little daily miseries of love,
    That I can take you in my arms at night
    With a quick tenderness,
    With a new delight,
    Yet go my way untroubled if I do not find you,
    Forgetting in my zest for many things
    There is a you.

    I wonder if you can ever understand?
    Do you not know
    That I would go
    Forth now to meet life’s great adventuring
    Alone?

    I would be unloosed from why and wherefore,
    I would not be stayed
    By sorrowing or rejoicing,
    Even the enchantment of your nearness,
    Or your touch at night
    Is powerless any more
    To come between my loneliness and me.

    They say that prisoners grow to love their chains,
    So now, after long years of bitter reaching out,
    Of crying to the winds
    And clasping only shadows of my dreaming,
    I love my torment.

    We are such old companions,
    Loneliness and I!
    We have learned to ask but little of each other;
    There is no longer any turning away
    With hurt, averted eyes;
    So, Beloved,
    Let me keep my loneliness for friend,
    The only friend I trust.

    When you and I first met
    And looked to each other’s eyes
    Our swift desire,
    I gave with reckless hands
    My life into your keeping.
    Upon your eyes, your words, your body’s grace
    I hung, poor fool, a-tremble;
    For you had power
    To blot the brightening day,
    To irradiate the night,
    With your sweet hands
    To lift me to the mountains where the spirits danced
    Or drag me through a hell of furious pain.

    And you would like to have that power again
    In your two hands?
    Oh no, my little one,
    No, my pretty one,
    Henceforward
    For all your sighing
    You shall but have my sudden, strong caresses,
    My tenderness, my love,
    But know
    That out, out, out I go
    Into the sun
    Alone.


THE WOMAN

    So, Man of mine!
    I may henceforward ask
    Only your strong caresses?
    I am your little one,
    I am your pretty one,
    Even your Beloved, now that you are free
    Of little fret and torment.
    I may give you pleasuring,
    But no more pain.
    Is that your meaning?
    I would be clear at last.
    Oh Man of mine,
    We are standing face to face,
    Now let there shine
    The search-light of our speech
    Across the night of silence.

    Before us two
    There lie dim years for traversing,
    Behind, a mist
    Through which we long time groped
    With futile hands,
    And now, today, we meet.

    Dear, do I not know
    That there were gleams across the darkness--
    Swift lightenings
    Towards which we onward pressed
    As, for an instant,
    Seeing our far quest
    Within our grasp?
    Perhaps these were your beckoning hands,
    Your dancing spirits on the mountain peaks,
    But not for long we saw them.
    And now today it seems
    That I must find
    What shall be done
    When you go out alone
    Into the sun.

    I have so often watched your silent face,
    Your quiet mouth,
    Your smooth, white brow,
    And longed for speech!
    I have so often wished to tell
    Of pent-up treasures in my breast
    You could not find!
    I would have given you such golden wealth
    Had you but come!
    Had you but said “I want your all.”
    But you were dumb.

    You went your ways silently
    And never asked my gift.
    Dear, day by day I lifted to your lips
    A chalice brimming with rich wine,
    And you but sipped a little and turned away,
    And the wine was spilled.

    The years have passed:
    There may not be upgathering
    Of wasted days,
    As seasons flushed and waned
    We have sown and reaped and harvested.
    Now, what shall come?

    I cannot go forth
    As you, into the Sun
    Alone,
    I cannot take
    My loneliness by the hand
    For chosen friend, as you.
    I am a woman and I want
    Not tenderness,
    Not strong caresses only,
    But the soul of you,
    My Man.


THE MAN

    Dear, give me your hands,
    Look into my eyes and tell me
    If you can find the soul of me.
    I think it has gone questing.
    Call it back!
    Recapture the wingèd thing,
    And I will give it gladly
    Into your keeping.
    But, dear heart, be fearful--
    Souls are delicate.
    What if mine died long since,
    What time it gave up seeking
    To find your own?
    Your eyes are wet, forgive!
    Let there be no more hurting,
    Joy there has been in our meeting.
    I would banish weeping.
    Let the still waters wash away pain
    Into the sea of forgetting.
    Still may we look into each other’s eyes,
    Still answer to the senses’ quick demand,
    But as the years have marked us in their passing
    So must we go onward--
    Hand in hand still,
    Yet alone.




_CHLOROFORM_

(_Written in collaboration with Arthur Davison Ficke._)


    A sickening odour, treacherously sweet,
    Steals through my sense heavily.
    Above me leans an ominous shape,
    Fearful, white-robed, hooded and masked in white.
    The pits of his eyes
    Peer like the portholes of an armoured ship,
    Merciless, keen, inhuman, dark.
    The hands alone are of my kindred;
    Their slender strength, that soon shall press the knife
    Silver and red, now lingers slowly above me,
    The last links with my human world ...

    ... The living daylight
    Clouds and thickens.
    Flashes of sudden clearness stream before me,--and then
    A menacing wave of darkness
    Swallows the glow with floods of vast and indeterminate grey.
    But in the flashes
    I see the white form towering,
    Dim, ominous,
    Like some apostate monk whose will unholy
    Has renounced God; and now
    In this most awful secret laboratory
    Would wring from matter
    Its stark and appalling answer.
    At the gates of a bitter hell he stands, to wrest with eager fierceness
    More of that dark forbidden knowledge
    Wherefrom his soul draws fervor to deny.

    The clouds have grown thicker; they sway around me
    Dizzying, terrible, gigantic; pressing in upon me
    Like a thousand monsters of the deep with formless arms.
    I cannot push them back, I cannot!
    From far, far off, a voice I knew long ago
    Sounds faintly thin and clear.
    Suddenly in a desperate rebellion I strive to answer,--
    I strive to call aloud,--
    But darkness chokes and overcomes me:
    None may hear my soundless cry.
    A depth abysmal opens,
    Receives, enfolds, engulfs me,--
    Wherein to sink at last seems blissful
    Even though to deeper pain....

    O respite and peace of deliverance!
    The silence
    Lies over me like a benediction.
    As in the earth’s first pale creation-morn
    Among winds and waters holy
    I am borne as I longed to be borne.
    I am adrift in the depths of an ocean grey
    Like seaweed, desiring solely
    To drift with the winds and waters; I sway
    Into their vast slow movements; all the shores
    Of being are laved by my tides.
    I am drawn out toward spaces wonderful and holy
    Where peace abides,
    And into golden æons far away.

    But over me
    Where I swing slowly,
    Bodiless in the bodiless sea,
    Very far,
    Oh very far away,
    Glimmeringly
    Hangs a ghostly star
    Toward whose pure beam I must flow resistlessly.
    Well do I know its ray!
    It is the light beyond the worlds of space,
    By groping, sorrowing man yet never known--
    The goal where all men’s blind and yearning desire
    Has vainly longed to go
    And has not gone:--
    Where Eternity has its blue-walled dwelling-place,
    And the crystal ether opens endlessly
    To all the recessed corners of the world,
    Like liquid fire
    Pouring a flood through the dimness revealingly;
    Where my soul shall behold, and in lightness of wonder rise higher
    Out of the shadow that long ago
    Around me with mortality was furled.

    I rise where have winds
    Of the night never flown;
    Shaken with rapture
    Is the vault of desire.
    The weakness that binds
    Like a shadow is gone.
    The bonds of my capture
    Are sundered with fire!

    This is the hour
    When the wonders open!
    The lightning-winged spaces
    Through which I fly
    Accept me, a power
    Whose prisons are broken--

           *       *       *       *       *

    ... But the wonder wavers--
    The light goes out.
    I am in the void no more; changes are imminent.
    Time with a million beating wings
    Deafens the air in migratory flight
    Like the roar of seas--and is gone ...
    And a silence
    Lasts deafeningly.
    In darkness and perfect silence
    I wander groping in my agony,
    Far from the light lost in the upper ether--
    Unknown, unknowable, so nearly mine.
    And the ages pass by me,
    Thousands each instant, yet I feel them all
    To the last second of their dragging time.
    Thus have I striven always
    Since the world began.
    And when it dies I still must struggle ...

           *       *       *       *       *

    The voice I knew so long ago, like a muffled echo under the sea
    Is coming nearer.
    Strong hands
    Grip mine.
    And words whose tones are warm with some forgotten consolation,
    Some unintelligible hope,
    Drag me upward in horrible mercy;
    And the cold once-familiar daylight glares into my eyes.

    He stands there,
    The white apostate monk,
    Speaking low lying words to soothe me.
    And I lift my voice out of its vales of agony
    And laugh in his face,
    Mocking him with astonishment of wonder.
    For he has denied;
    And I have come so near, so near to knowing....
    Then as his hand touches me gently, I am drawn up from the lonely abysses,
    And suffer him to lead me back into the green valleys of the living.




_THE BEGINNING OF THE JOURNEY_


    Where are you, Dear?
    What is it that I hold--
    A shape, a phantom, who will not ease my pain?
    O Beloved! My beloved!
    What is it comes between our seeking arms?
    Lip to lip we press
    And breast to breast,
    Straining to overleap the barrier,
    And all the while we know
    We are apart.
    We know tomorrow we shall be
    More horribly
    Alone.

    Do you remember
    When we first cried out each to each?
    How the valleys rang with laughter and gay words
    And eager promises?
    Do you remember how we told each other
    Pain was over,
    That nothing now could come
    We could not still with kisses?
    Do you remember those first days
    When the world was lost in a dream and a forgetting
    And eternity was ours?

    Then, as the years followed,
    Do you remember how we found
    That pain must be?
    How, heavy-hearted, we gazed bewildered
    Into each other’s eyes,
    Asking, why?

    One night you would not speak,
    And when I pressed you for your cause of silence
    You said “I tried to tell you once
    My heart’s dim heaviness,
    But you are a man, you can never understand.”
    And then I saw
    That we were far away from one another,
    For I had thought the same.

    And after
    In a quick ache of sympathy
    We kissed and clung,
    And then you slept.
    I heard the little sobbing breaths
    Like a hurt child’s
    Of a loneliness I had no power to soothe.
    We asked so much!
    We looked to each other as some look to God,
    And when God came not
    And our lifted hands were empty
    We cried out that love was dead.

    We have grown patient since
    And pitifully wise,
    We see how little may be given,
    And we are thankful
    Lest there be nothing.
    Yet even when I lay my wearied head
    Upon your knees and fall asleep
    To waken with your hand on my hot brow,
    Then, when I thank God, if there be a God,
    For you--
    We are apart.

    Yesterday I watched you
    Protect the child against the winter cold.
    Warmly you wrapped him
    While his baby face laughed back at you
    From its frame of softest fur:
    I think a great hand comes and wraps us so,
    Each in his loneliness as in an enfolding garment,
    That we shall be ready
    To make our last great journeying
    Alone.

    As the years go onward
    Little by little we turn
    And draw away from love’s dominion,
    Little by little we loose the clinging hands
    That hinder from adventuring,
    Oftener and more often
    We go apart
    To ask ourselves
    The inevitable question.
    The friends we seek are questioners
    Who strive, like us, to cross with thoughts
    The illimitable void:

    Therefore, Dear, give over
    Trying to comfort,
    Give over the wish to yield me
    All I need--

    Once long ago I lost myself in you,
    Once long ago I was but part of you,
    Bereft without you,
    Mad for lack of you,
    Now I am I,
    Preparing to go onward
    When the end shall come
    Alone.

STORIES IN METRE




_THE PRISONER_


    “We had a prisoner once,” the Warden said,
    “Who was no common man. I could not say
    To make it clear, where lay the difference,
    And yet, and yet,--something was there I know.”

    “Tell me of him,” I said, drawing a chair,
    Knowing that in the old man’s heart there lay
    Many a story.

                    “Willingly,” he answered,
    “Yet when all’s said, you’ll know no more than I
    Why his words puzzle me; why, when I pass
    His cell, I always think that I can see
    His eyes, his following eyes, that seemed to ask
    Over and over again, some kind of question.”

    He thought a moment, then began his story
    As if by careful measuring of his words
    He tried to make me see what he found dim.

    “You know the row of cells,” he said, “they built
    To make the fourth row ’round the hollow square?
    They front the East, and so I put him there.
    I’d hardly like to say what was the reason,--
    It seems so foolish; but, the day he came,
    Just as the big door opened, I had seen
    Him turn his head, and this is what he said:
    ‘And it is I,--I, who have loved the Dawn!’
    A queer thing, wasn’t it? I suppose he thought
    That he would never see it any more.

    “It’s strange how little things come back to you!
    I can remember when he saw his cell
    He bent his head, making a kind of greeting,
    Then quickly stepped across and glanced around:
    ‘And this is what I have to call my home’
    Was what he thought, I guess. It always seems
    To sicken me somehow, to show ’em in,
    The hopeful ones the most, I know so well
    How soon the eager look will disappear!”

    “But tell me what he was in prison for?”
    I said, and met the old man’s quick “What for?
    Oh well, there wasn’t room enough outside.
    Why do you want to know? What does it matter?
    He was no common man. You’d think by now
    I’d stop my foolish bothering. I’m used
    Enough, God knows, to tangled human threads--
    Oh what’s the use to try and tell it now?
    I’m such a fool! I can’t go by his cell
    Without the wondering clutching at me here!”
    He laid his hand upon his breast; I thought
    His mind had dwelt too long with pain, and now
    His fancies troubled him. “Mad then, perhaps?”
    I asked, and saw my blundering words had been
    Salt to a wound. He turned away and said
    “No, no, he was not that, not mad,” and stepped
    Beside a shelf of little useless things
    Fumbling among them.

                          Presently he turned
    And placed within my hands a woman’s picture.
    I took it silently, afraid to comment.
    “Think what you please,” he said, “for I don’t know,
    As no one came to take away his things
    I kept the picture. It was dear to him.”

    A gentle woman’s face looked up at me;
    A tender face, lips parted, young grave eyes.
    I seemed to see within their depths a question,
    And turned to meet the old man’s twisted smile.
    Nodding, he murmured, “So, you see it too?”
    Then took the picture from me and began
    Again, though haltingly, his troubled tale.

    “At first he read and spoke and ate his food
    As if he thought he would not be here long
    And must be patient. Often he would ask
    What time it was, or if it rained or shone,
    Begging for outside news, and when I brought
    Letters or papers, seized them greedily
    And strained his eyes to get the contents quickly.
    Sometimes he’d hail me as I passed along
    With such a flow of eager questioning talk,
    I wondered anyone so rich in words
    Could bear his solitude and not go mad
    With silence; but--our prison rules are stern.
    I shot the bolts that dulled that silver voice,
    And now I hear it echoing down the years.”

    The old man rose and made a little pretence
    To put the picture back upon the shelf.

    “Well, time went on,” seating himself, he said,
    “And as I made my rounds each day I thought
    The prisoner seemed to draw himself away.
    Not rudely; more as if he could not break
    The current of his thoughts, and up and down
    He’d walk; they all do that, but he as if
    He had some light inside his mind. Don’t think
    I’m crazy, but,--it’s hard to put in words.
    Sometimes I’d have my little try to break
    Across the distance. With a sudden smile
    He’d lay his hand upon me--‘Yes, I know,
    I know,’ and so would push me to the door.
    I feared to go to him, and yet I loved
    The man as if he’d been my son. I knew
    The end was coming soon. My heart was sore,
    But I was powerless.

                        “One thing alone
    Could wean him from his strange expectancy,
    A little written word that came half-yearly.
    I knew that it was due, and when it came
    I beat upon his door; I had the letter--
    Slowly he turned to meet me and I stopped,
    Seeing it was too late.

                            “Then from my hands
    He took the letter, lifting it silently,
    The way a priest lifts up the sacrament,
    Then gave it slowly back to me and said,
    ‘Why bring me bread? So little, little bread?
    Why eke my life along so grudgingly?
    Take back the letter, I am far away,
    Keep back the bread and I shall sooner know.’
    And followed by his eyes, I left the cell
    And soon he died.

                      “No no, he was not mad,
    But only one to whom the Dawn was real.”




_ELLIE_


    She came to do my nails.
    Came in my door and stood before me waiting,
    A great big lummox of a girl--
    A continent.
    Her dress was rusty black
    And scant,
    Her hat, a melancholy jumble of basement counter bargains.
    Her sullen eyes,
    Like a whipped animal’s,
    Shone out between her silly bulging cheeks and puffy forehead.

    She dropped her coat upon a chair
    And waited;
    Then, at a word, busied herself
    With files and delicate scissors,
    Sweet-smelling oils and my ten finger-tips.

    She proved so deft and silent
    I bade her come again;
    And twice a week
    While summer dawned and flushed and waned
    She used me in her parasitic trade.
    The dress grew rustier,
    The hat more melancholy,
    And Ellie fatter.

    Each time she came I wondered as she worked
    If thought lay anywhere
    Behind that queer uncouthness.
    She had a trick of seizing with her eyes
    Each passing thing,
    An insatiate greediness for something out of reach;
    And yet she seemed enwrapped
    In a kind of solemn patience,
    Large, aloof and waiting.
    We hardly ever spoke--
    I could not think of anything worth saying;
    One does not chatter with a continent.
    Finally it was homing time;
    The seashore town was raw and desolate
    And idlers flitted.
    The last day Ellie came
    Her calm was gone, she had been crying.
    Fat people never ought to cry;
    It’s awful....
    The hot drops fell upon my hand
    While Ellie dropped the scissors suddenly
    And sniffed and blew and sobbed
    In disconcerting and unreserved abandonment.
    I said the usual things;
    I would have patted her but for the grease,
    But Ellie was not comforted.

    Not until the storm was spent
    And only little catching breaths were left
    I got the reason.
    “I’m so fat,” she gulped, “so awful, awful fat
    The boys won’t look at me.”
    And then it came, the stammered, passionate cry:
    Could I not help?
    Could I not find a medicine?
    We talked and talked
    And when at dusk she went, a teary smile
    Hovered a moment on her mouth
    And in those sullen, swollen eyes
    A little hope perhaps;
    I did not know.

    The city and its interests soon engulfed me.
    A letter or two,
    A doctor’s vague advice to bant and exercise,
    And Ellie and her woes passed from my mind
    Until, as summer dawned again,
    I heard that she was dead.
    A curious letter written stiffly,
    From Ellie’s mother,
    Told me I was invited to the funeral
    “By wish of the Deceased.”

    Wondering I travelled to the little town
    Where the sea beat and groaned
    And sorrowed endlessly,
    And made my way down the steep street
    To Ellie’s door.
    Her mother met me in the hall
    And motioned,
    “She wanted you to see her,”
    Then ushered me into an awful place, the parlor--
    A place of emerald plush and golden oak
    Set round with pride and symmetry,
    And in the midst
    A black and silver coffin--
    Ellie’s coffin.
    Raising the lid she pointed and I looked.

    Somewhere in Florence Mino da Fiesole
    Has made a tomb
    Where deathless beauty lies with upturned face.
    Two gentle hands, palms meeting,
    Touch with their pointed forefingers
    A delicate chin, and over the vibrant body
    Clings a white robe
    Enshrouding chastely
    Warm curving lines of adolescent grace.
    No sleeper this,--
    The figure glows, alert, awake, aware,
    As if some sudden ecstacy had stolen life
    And held imprisoned there
    The moment of attainment
    Rapt, imperishable and fair.

    Even so lay Ellie,
    And when from somewhere far I heard
    The mother’s voice
    I listened vacantly.

    The woman chattered on,
    “The dress you know, white chiffon, like a wedding dress--
    I never knew she had it,
    She must ’a made it by herself.
    It’s queer it fitted perfectly
    An’ her all thin like that--
    She must ’a thought--”

    Then black-robed relatives came streaming in
    To look at Ellie.
    I watched them start
    And glance around for explanation.
    The mother pinched my arm:
    “Don’t ask me anything now,” she whispered;
    “Come back tonight.”

    Then old, old words were sung and prayed and droned,
    While everybody dutifully cried,
    And when the village parson
    Rhythmically proclaimed,
    And this mortal shall put on immortality,--
    With a great welcoming
    And a great lightening
    I knew at last the ancient affirmation.

    When evening came I found the mother
    Sitting amidst her golden oak and plush
    In a kind of isolated stateliness.
    She led me in.
    “’Twas the stuff she took that did it,”
    She began; “I never knew till after she was dead.
    The bottles in the woodshed, hundreds of ’em
    All labelled ‘Caldwell’s Great Obesity Cure
    Warranted Safe and Rapid.’
    Oh ain’t it awful?” and she fell to crying miserably;
    “But wasn’t she real pretty in her coffin?”
    And then she cried again
    And clung to me.




_THE PARK BENCH_


A STRANGER, A MAN, A WOMAN

    _The pallid night wind touched their burning cheeks
    With fetid breath, whispered a dim distress
    And flickered out; while whirling insects danced
    Their crazy steps with death around the light._

THE STRANGER

    The night is hot and the crowds intolerable,
    May I sit here between you on this bench?

THE MAN

    I s’pose the bench is free to anybody.

THE STRANGER

    I’ve been walking up and down and wondering
    If I should speak. You sat here silently,
    You two. I could not tell what troubled you.

THE WOMAN

    I guess I was thinkin’, Mister. I didn’t know
    There was any other person anywhere near.

THE MAN

    I don’t know who she is. She’s nothin’ to me.
    She’s got a kid there in her shawl, maybe
    Her trouble’s there.

THE STRANGER

                          It’s hard to keep up courage;
    The heat is sickening, it weighs you down.
    I’d like to see the child; may I see its face?

THE WOMAN

    He’s two weeks old today.

THE STRANGER

                            A sturdy youngster!
    What do you call him? What’s his name, I mean?
    Don’t turn away. I meant no harm, you know.

THE MAN

    Didn’t I tell you? Something’s wrong, I guess. Maybe
    He’s deserted, with another comin’ on.
    Ask her again; likely she’s needin’ help.

THE STRANGER

    You seem unhappy. Can’t you tell me why?
    I’d like to help you if I can, because--
    Well, once I had a little son like that.
    Come! what have you got to tell? Out with the story.
    See there, the boy is stretching out a hand,
    He knows a friend is somewhere ’round, eh, Sonny?

THE WOMAN

    You’d like to know what I have got to tell?
    I guess you don’t know what you’re askin’, Mister.
    You see that big house over there? You see
    This baby blinkin’ here? Well, that’s the house
    His father lives in. I just found it out,
    Found where it was, I mean, then I come here--
    Oh, what’s the sense o’ tellin’ any more?
    That’s all there is, I guess.

THE STRANGER

                                I’d like the story;
    Sometimes the pain is eased by speaking out.

THE WOMAN

    I don’t know why you want to know about me,
    It’s no concern of yours, but if you’ll promise
    You’ll let him be, I’ll tell you all there is.

THE STRANGER

    You have my promise.

THE WOMAN

                              More’n a year ago
    It was, I seen him first, an’ ’twasn’t long
    Before I thought a lot and so did he.
    He said he’d take a flat and furnish it
    And we’d keep house together all alone.
    He said he had to travel, but he’d come
    As often as he could, and stay as long.
    I’d worked, you know; I never had a place
    I liked to live in, an’ he let me buy
    A lot of things I wanted; then he’d laugh
    And say I liked the flat so much, perhaps
    He’d better stay away and not muss up
    The tidies on the chairs. He always had
    A lot of money. When he gave me some
    He’d never say how much it was, but just,
    “Here’s more to buy the tidies with,” and laugh.
    It wasn’t long--that little time. I like
    To think about it, but it seems so far!
    Just like another city or a place
    That wasn’t any more; I don’t know why,
    I guess the flat’s there still, if I should go--
    Hush, honey, hush--don’t you be cryin’ now.

    I s’pose I’d ought to tell you that he said
    I mustn’t have the kid. I didn’t care;
    I didn’t want it, neither. When I knew,
    I had to tell, because I got so sick.
    He didn’t say a word to make me cry,
    Not much of anything. He put a lot
    Of money in the drawer and went away--
    I never seen him since, until--today.
    Until--today--over there, this afternoon
    I seen him laughin’ with another kid,
    And mine right here, right here, do you understand?

THE STRANGER

    I think I understand, but please go on.

THE WOMAN

    I told you he’d put money in the drawer;
    I hated takin’ it; but o’ course it lasted
    For quite a while,--until I had to go
    And be took care of at a hospital.
    At first I tried to find him, but I knew
    He didn’t want me to. I thought perhaps
    When I could take the kid, he’d like it then.
    When I was packin’ up I found a paper,
    A bill, I guess, all rumpled, in a coat
    He left. It had a name I didn’t know.
    At first I didn’t think, but lyin’ there
    All quiet in the hospital I saw
    It was his name, his truly name, and where
    He lived and all. This afternoon my time
    Was up--by rights I’d oughta left the ward
    Four days ago. They gave me this, for the food,
    Directions how to fix it right, you know,
    And told me I could go, and so I came.
    I thought he’d surely want to see me now,
    When I was well again, just like I was.

    I waited in the park and watched the house,
    It looked so big I couldn’t ring the bell.
    Maybe ’twas six o’clock I saw him come;
    Just by the steps a baby carriage turned
    And waited for him comin’ up the street.
    The woman wheelin’ it called out “Look there!
    There’s Daddy! Can’t you throw a kiss to him?”
    I saw him lift the baby ’way up high,
    And carry it in the house. Then I come here.

THE STRANGER

    I see. And that is all you plan to do?
    I mean, you won’t go back?

THE WOMAN

                                  What can I do?
    You see, he doesn’t want me any more.
    I’d like to die, but here’s the kid! I guess
    I can’t leave him. An’ anyway I’m ’fraid
    To die alone. I don’ know what I’ll do.

THE MAN

    I wish that I could think of anything
    To say that maybe’d help a little bit.
    May I just--shake your hand?--Excuse me, Mister.

THE WOMAN

    I didn’t know as you was listenin’ too.

THE MAN

    Perhaps you’d like to hear what’s happened to me.
    You’ll see that somebody has known the like
    Of what you’re feelin’, maybe it will help.

THE STRANGER

    Ah! I was right then? Both of you are troubled?
    The night has brought us three together here;
    We must be friends. It’s queer how loneliness
    Makes one reach one, as I have reached, to you.
    I think each one of us needs both the others.

THE MAN

    Well, Mister, you don’t look as if you’d need
    Our help, but maybe you do, maybe, who knows?
    I’ll tell you what’s been happening to me.
    I’m sick of thoughts goin’ round and round and round,
    I wonder if anybody’ll ever know,
    I mean to understand, what I’ve been thinkin’.

THE STRANGER

    Why don’t you start? We’ll try to understand.

THE MAN

    I’ll tell you first that I’m a drinking man,
    And that’s a thing that causes lots of trouble.
    She’s not to blame, she stood it for a while.
    She had the children, there are two, you know,
    But I was pretty bad. I hated it,
    But there it was, and every day a fight,
    And oftener and oftener I’d lose.
    One day she went away and took the children.
    They served some papers on me; I was drunk
    And didn’t care; but pretty soon I knew
    That she had gone for good. A lawyer came
    And talked to me, after she’d talked to him.
    And afterwards I saw her in the Court.
    The Judge said I must leave our house, and if,
    For two years, I could cut the liquor out
    She’d let me back.

                      And so I got a room
    About two blocks away where I could see
    The children as they passed along to school.
    Sometimes I’d walk a little way with them,
    But when I couldn’t answer all their questions
    I’d think I’d better let ’em be, and so
    I’d only watch ’em from behind the blind.
    Well, Ma’am, I tried my best; I made a calendar
    To mark the days. I got a good promotion.
    The time went by, and all the while I thought
    Two years are only seven hundred days
    And thirty over! I can stick it out!
    And then one day I’ll dress myself up clean
    And meet the children and we’ll go back home.
    I’d marked the calendar six hundred off
    And eighty-six, and forty-four were left.
    The heat came on and took the starch all out
    Of everything. I didn’t care what happened.
    I thought she didn’t mean to keep her promise--
    A week ago--oh, well, you know the rest.
    I don’t know where I’ve been. I’d like to die,
    Only I’ve been so lonesome in that room.
    I seem to be afraid to die alone!

THE WOMAN

    I’m awful sorry, Mister, awful sorry.
    Seems like tonight most everybody’s luck
    Has all gone back on ’em. Thank you for tellin’!

THE STRANGER

    There’s no use sitting here in silence, is there?
    We’ve got to find some way to help you both.
    I’d like to if I can, but anyhow,
    We’ve helped each other just by speaking out.
    If you’ll wait here I’ll get a cab and take
    You and the baby to the Sisters’ Home.
    Perhaps you’ll come to my office in the morning;
    I’d like to talk to you; I’m sure we’ll find
    There’s something we can plan. Here is the address.
    I sha’n’t be long, keep talking so’s to cheer her,
    It was a kindly thought of yours to tell
    Your story after hers. We’ll find some way.

THE WOMAN

    What ’ud he mean? About the Sisters’ Home?

THE MAN

    Some place where you an’ the kid can go, I s’pose.

THE WOMAN

    It’s queer how everybody’s good to you
    ’Ceptin’ the only one you want to be.

THE MAN

    He said it wasn’t any use to sit
    Here silent; that you’d better speak it out;
    It always helped. He said he’d find a way.
    Do you believe there’s anything ahead
    For you or me? I wonder if there is.

THE WOMAN

    I’m done with wonderin’ long ago, I know!
    I want to die! God, how I want to die!
    But here’s the kid, he didn’t ask to come,
    And he’s so little, what ’ud become of him?

THE MAN

    Do you believe there’s anything--over there?

THE WOMAN

    There’s rest.

THE MAN

                  I know there’s rest, but when I’ve sat
    All by myself there in that little room
    Thinking things out, sometimes it seemed there must
    Be something more. I’d mighty well like to know.

THE WOMAN

    If I could find someone to take the kid
    I’d like to rest, just rest, I wouldn’t want
    Much of anything more. There isn’t anything.
    I wish I wasn’t scared to die alone.

THE MAN

    You said that once before. Do you mean it, really?

THE WOMAN

    What are you thinkin’ about? Say it out, say it out!

THE MAN

    What if we went together, you and I?
    There ain’t any use of livin’ any more.
    We’d find out something, anyhow.

THE WOMAN

    You mean--

THE MAN

    I mean I’m sick o’ livin’, so are you.
    Put the kid down there by the evergreens.
    He’ll come and find it--he said he’d get a cab;
    He’ll take it to the Sisters. Oh, I’m crazy!
    Don’t put it there! Take it up again, I say!
    A little kid like that! Don’t listen to me.

THE WOMAN

    He’s sleeping now; he’ll never know what’s happened.

THE MAN

    You’re goin’ to? Well, come along then fast
    Or he’ll come back. We’re both of us crazy now,
    But what’s the sense of livin’ any more?
    Maybe there’s something better--over there.

THE WOMAN

    Wait till I fix him comfortable. Say, Mister,
    I was lookin’ at the river, by the pier,
    Only I was afraid. Will you stay beside me?

THE MAN

    Yes, that’s the place, come quickly, ’twon’t take long.

THE WOMAN

    Maybe we could find a piece of iron
    Or something heavy, so’s they wouldn’t find us;
    There’s lots around the pier.

THE MAN

                                    I’ll tell you what:
    I’ll tie our hands together to the iron
    So the waves won’t--




_THE SISTERS_


    We four
    Live here together
    My three old sisters and I
    In a white cottage
    With flowers on each side of the path up to the door.
    It is here we eat together,
    At eight, one, and seven,
    All the year round,
    It is here we sew together
    On garments for the Church sewing society
    Here,--behind our fresh white dimity curtains
    That I’ll soon have to do up and darn again.
    It is this cottage we mean
    When we use the word Home.
    Is it not here we lie down and sleep
    Each night all near together?

    We never meet
    My three old sisters and I.
    We never look into each others’ eyes
    We never look into each others’ souls,
    Or if we do for a moment
    We quickly begin to talk about the jam
    How much sugar to put in and when.
    We run away and hide, like mice before the light;
    We are afraid to look into each others’ souls
    So we keep on sewing, sewing.

    My three old sisters are old
    Very old.
    It is not such a great while since they were born
    Yet they are old.
    I think it is because they will not look and see.
    I am not old
    But pretty soon I will be.
    I was thinking of that when I went to him
    Where he was waiting.

    My sisters had been talking together all the long afternoon
    While I sat sewing and silent,
    Clacking, clacking away while the lilac scent came in at the window
    And the branches beckoned and sighed.
    This is what they said--
    “How did that paper come into our house?”
    “Fit to be burnt, don’t you think?”
    Then the third, “It’s a shameless sheet
    To print such a sensual thing.”
    The paper lay on the table there, between my three sisters
    With my poem in it,--
    My little happy poem without any name.
    I had been with him when I wrote it and I wanted him again.
    The words arose in my heart clamouring for birth--
    And there they were, between my three sisters.
    Each read it in turn
    Holding the paper far off with the tips of her fingers.
    Then they hustled it into the fire
    Giving it an extra poke with the tongs, a vicious poke.
    Then each sister settled back to her sewing
    With a satisfied air.
    I looked at them and I wondered.
    I looked at each one,
    And I went to him that night--
    Where he was waiting.

    My three old sisters are dying
    Though they do not know it.
    They are not dying serenely
    After life is over,
    They are just getting dryer and dryer
    And sharper and sharper;
    Soon there will not be any more of them at all.

    I am not like them
    I cannot be
    For I have a reason for living.
    While they were picking their little pale odourless blossoms
    I gathered my great red flower
    And oh I am glad, glad,
    For now when the time comes I can die serenely,
    I can die after living.
    But first what is to come?
    I am going to give my three old sisters a shock
    Then what a rumpus there will be!
    They will upbraid and reproach
    And then they will whisper to each other, nodding slowly and sadly
    Telling each other it is not theirs to judge.
    So they will become kind and pitiful
    Affirming that I am their sister
    And that they will stick by and see me through.
    But underneath they will be touching me with the lifted tips of their fingers.
    They would like to hustle me into the fire
    With an extra poke of the tongs.

    Perhaps I will pretend to hang my head,
    Perhaps I will to please them,
    I am very obliging--
    But in my heart I shall be laughing with a great laughter,
    A great exaltation.

    Yes they will upbraid and reproach
    In grave and sisterly accents
    And mourn over me,
    One who has fallen;
    Yet I suspect
    As each one goes to her cold little room,
    Deep in her breast she will envy
    With a terrible envy
    The child that is mine
    And the night
    The incredible night
    When the sun and the moon and the stars
    Bent down
    And gave me their secrets.




_REASON_


    Doctor! Doctor! I want you to come in.
    Doctor! Don’t you hear me? Don’t go by!
    That’s right, come in here now and shut the door.
    Sit down there in that chair
    And listen.
    Don’t sit there with that silly smile all over you.
    I’m going to make you listen.

    You know when I first came they wanted me to talk.
    I could see them trying, with little tricks and questions.
    Well, now I will,--
    I’ll tell you if you’ll let me out.
    Will you, Doctor? Will you?
    Those bars there at the window make me sick,
    And the screaming all around.
    You have to holler too, to keep from hearing!
    The nurse said I’d be in the padded room
    If I kept on--
    Say, Doctor, will you let me out
    After I’ve told you everything there is?
    Will you? Will you? Will you?

    Oh very well,
    You can open the door then now.
    I don’t want you any more; I’ll never tell--
    Say, Doctor, don’t go yet awhile;
    Turn round, don’t go, I want to talk to you.
    There, please sit down again, I’ll promise not to holler.
    I’ll tell you all about it and then you’ll see--
    You’ll let me go, I know you will.
    I tell you I’ve got to go and find ’em,
    Find ’em all--Father and Grandfather,
    All that made me go back home,
    That made me do it--
    But you don’t know,
    I’ll have to find some place to start at.

    The first night that he tried to get at me, and he like that,
    I cried,
    Soon as he saw me crying he went off
    And got a quilt
    And made a bed out in the sitting-room.
    He got up early so I didn’t see him.
    I thought all day,
    And I kissed him when he came at supper time.

    That night he seemed just like he was at first,
    I mean when we were married first,
    I thought he wouldn’t do it ever again--
    Say, Doctor, don’t you tell,
    But somebody came when I was out
    And fixed his food up so’s he’d want the stuff,
    I know who it was, but I won’t tell,
    Not till I’m out of here.

    She did it out of spite, I know, I know--
    Doctor, who is that hollerin’? Make her stop--
    I guess you’d think it “mattered” some
    If you heard it all the time--
    Well, finally I couldn’t keep him in the sitting-room,
    I had to let him in, he hammered so,
    And then--Oh, Doctor, stop her please!
    I don’t see what she’s hollerin’ for,
    Nobody got in her bed reeling drunk--
    I couldn’t help him coming--I couldn’t, an’ I tried!

    Next day I went around and did the dishes up,
    And cooked the dinner ready, and all the time I thought
    “Supposing it’s happened--what’ll the child be then?
    What’ll I have to bring into the world?
    Supposing it’s happened--”

    Perhaps it was nearly supper time,
    I don’t know clearly,
    But I couldn’t stay, I couldn’t!
    I left a letter for him and went home.
    I walked around the corner of the house and there they were
    Sitting at supper, Father and Grandfather
    And Ma and little Ben.
    I stood and looked at them.
    It seemed such a little while since I was sitting there
    Not thinkin’ anything,
    Finally I went in and said
    “I’ve come home,--I’ve come away from Jim, I mean.
    Don’t everybody look at me like that--
    I tell you I’ve come home.”

    Then Ma got up and took me in her room
    And fixed the bed for me--
    She said we’d talk it over in the morning.

    I stayed pretty near two months at home,
    And all the while Father and Grandfather
    And even little Ben
    Were at me to go back,
    Father kept saying all he wanted was my happiness.
    And then they got the clergyman
    And he talked just the same.
    And then Jim came.
    They all were nice to him and Jim was dreadfully sorry.
    He hadn’t had a drop, he said, and if I’d come
    He’d never touch a single thing again--
    Oh, Doctor, make her stop!
    Go make her stop, I say, what’s she got to holler for?
    Don’t forget you promised if I’d tell
    You’d let me out--
    Do you want to hear the rest?
    I’m telling you straight enough, more’n I told the family--
    I never told them anything,
    I mean what I thought might happen,
    And nobody ever had the sense to guess
    What I was afraid of,
    Nobody but Ma,
    And after the first she didn’t do anything but cry
    And say Father knew best.

    The second time Jim came, I said I’d go,
    I was so tired of everybody talkin’ at me--
    Oh I don’t want to tell you any more--
    I’m crazy with her hollerin’.
    You know the rest--I squeezed his eyes out--
    ’Cause he was lookin’ at me
    When I let him in--after his hammerin’--
    Then they brought me here--

    Doctor, I’ve told you everything.
    Doctor, let me out!
    Let me out! Let me out! Let me out!




_HER SECRET_


    My secret and I stand here in front of the glass.
    We are bedecking ourselves for an evening of gayety.
    We look down and make our lips smile--
    We look up and make ourselves laugh,
    And then we turn and look into the glass again
    To see if others will believe that our eyes are smiling too.

    How long will it last, the evening?
    It will be three hours at least, maybe four.
    There will be music and bright dresses and clinking and chattering
    And everybody will laugh; there will be a great deal of laughter.
    Everybody will go about with smiling lips,
    But if you stop and look
    You will see that everybody’s eyes are hungry.

    None of them shall know my secret
    No one knows that--
    Not any one in all the world.

    There was one other knew
    But he is dead.
    I heard that he was dead just now--

    A little while ago--
    Just a few minutes ago by the clock.
    I was putting on my beautiful dress
    When I heard a list read out from the paper, many names,
    A long, long list.
    I went on fastening my embroidered slippers
    While they read and read--
    It came while I was buttoning my gloves, my long gloves;
    There are a number of buttons.
    No one shall guess my secret.

    There is a woman somewhere,
    I do not know where she is;
    But all her friends are hastening,
    Coming from all about
    To surround her with their melancholy faces.

    Soon they will get for her a black dress and a long black veil.
    They will lead her faltering to a church,
    Her two wondering children held to her side, one by each hand.
    She will be very important.
    They will say beautiful things about him--
    Beautiful sad things--
    And all the time, hid by her long black veil,
    Her eyes will be smiling--smiling.

    And what have I of him?
    What shall I take with me to the party?
    Only the memory of that last dawn
    When I gave him all and bade him go.




_A LITTLE GIRL_


I

    I see a little girl sitting bent over
    On a white stone door-step.
    In the street are other children running about;
    The shadows of the waving trees flicker on their white dresses.

    Some one opens the door of the house
    And speaks to the child on the steps.
    She looks up and asks an eager question.
    The figure shakes her head and shuts the door.
    The child covers up her face
    To hide her tears.


II

    Three children are playing in a garden--
    Two boys and an awe-struck little girl;
    They have plastered the summer-house with clay,
    Making it an unlovely object.

    A grown-up person comes along the path.
    The little girl runs to her and stops,
    Asking the same question--“Where is my Mother?”
    The grown-up person does not make any answer.
    She looks at the summer-house and passes along the path.

    The little girl goes slowly into the house
    And climbs the stairs.


III

    The little girl is alone in the garden.
    A white-haired lady of whom she is afraid
    Comes to find her and tell her a joyful thing.

    The little girl runs to the nursery.
    The young nurse is doing her hair in front of the glass.
    The little girl sees how white her neck is
    And her uplifted arms.

    Tomorrow they will be gone--they will not be here--
    They are going to find--Her.
    The young nurse turns and smiles
    And takes the little girl in her arms.


IV

    The little girl is travelling on a railway train,
    Everything rushes by very fast,--
    Houses, and children in front of them,
    Children who are just staying at home.

    The train cannot go fast enough,
    The little girl is saying over and over again,
    “My Mother--My onliest Mother--
    I am coming to you, coming very fast.”


V

    The little girl looks up at a great red building
    With a great doorway.
    It opens and the little girl is led in,
    Looking all about her.
    A Lady in a white dress and white cap comes.

    After a long time
    A man in a black coat comes in.
    He says “She is not well enough, I am afraid.”
    The little girl is led away.
    She always remembers the words
    The man in the black coat said.


VI

    The little girl is waiting in the big hallway,
    In the house of the white-haired lady.
    At the end of the path she can see the summer-house
    With its queer grey cover.

    The hall clock ticks very slowly.
    The hands must go all around again
    Before the mother will come.

    Now it is night.
    The little girl is lying in her bed.
    There is a piano going somewhere downstairs.
    She is telling herself a story and waiting.
    Soon She will come in at the door.

    There will be a swift shaft of light
    Across the floor.
    And She will come in with a rustling sound.
    She will lie down on the bed
    And the little girl will stroke her dress and crinkle it
    To make the sound again.

    Pretty soon the mother will step slowly and softly to the door,
    And quietly turn the handle.
    The little girl will speak and stop her,
    Asking something she has asked many times before,--“My Father?”
    But the mother has never anything to answer.


VII

    The mother and the little girl are sitting together sewing.
    Outside there is snow.
    A woman with a big white apron
    Comes to the door of the room and speaks.

    The mother drops her work on the floor
    And runs down the stairs.
    The little girl stands at the head of the stairs
    And cries out “My Father!” but no one hears.
    They pass along the hall--

    The little girl creeps down the stairs,
    But the door is closed.


VIII

    The little girl is held and rocked,
    Held so tightly it hurts her.
    She moves herself free.

    Then quickly she puts her face up close,
    And there is a taste of salt on her tongue.


IX

    In a bed in an upper chamber,
    A bed with high curtains,
    A woman sits bowed over.
    Her hair streams over her shoulders,
    Her arms are about two children.

    The older one is trying to say comforting things,
    The little girl wants to slip away,--
    There are so many people at the foot of the bed--

    Out of the window, across the yellow river
    There are houses climbing up the hillside.
    The little girl wonders if anything like this
    Is happening in any of those houses.


X

    Many children and grown-up people
    Are standing behind their chairs around a bright table
    Waiting for the youngest child to say grace.

    It is very troublesome for the youngest child
    To get the big words out properly.
    The little girl interrupts and says the grace quickly.

    The white-haired lady of whom the little girl is afraid
    Is angry.
    The little girl breaks away and runs
    To the room of the bed with the high curtains.

    She rushes in--
    The room is empty.
    She comes back to the table,
    But she does not dare to ask the question.
    She remembers the great red building
    With the great doorway.


XI

    The little girl is trying to read a fairy story.
    There is nobody in the garden.
    There is nobody in the house but the white-haired lady.

    Someone comes to tell her her father is there--
    She does not want to see him,
    She is afraid.


XII

    The front door is open.
    There is rain, leaves are whirling about.
    A carriage with two horses
    And a coachman high up, holding a long whip,
    Stands waiting in front of the door.

    The little girl is holding onto the banisters.
    They take away her hands from the banisters
    And lead her to the carriage in front of the door.
    Someone gets in behind her,
    The carriage door is shut,
    The little girl draws herself to the far corner.
    They drive away.
    The little girl looks back out of the window.


XIII

    The little girl is in a strange house
    Where there are young men called uncles
    Who talk to her and laugh.
    A large lady sits by the table and knits and smiles,
    In her basket are different coloured balls of wool,
    Pretty colours, but not enough to make a pattern.
    There is a curly soft little black dog
    That hides under the table.
    The uncles pull him out,
    And he tries to hold onto the carpet with his claws.
    The little girl laughs--
    But at the sound she turns away
    And goes up to her room and shuts the door.
    Pretty soon the large lady comes to her
    And takes her on her lap and rocks and sings.

           *       *       *       *       *



XIV

    The little girl has grown taller,
    She is fair and sweet and ready for love,
    But over her is a great fear
    As she remembers her mother’s weeping.

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

provided that:

    • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method

        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
