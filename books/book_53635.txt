It is now thirty-three years since the first volume of biographies
bearing the title “Representative Canadians” was issued by the present
firm of publishers. In 1886 the scope of the work was unique, so far as
this country was concerned, for previous volumes of the kind had
confined themselves to the careers of Canadians who have won fame in
either a political or military capacity. The aim of the editors of the
first volume of “Representative Canadians” was to give recognition of
the emergence of Canada from a colonial to something like a national
status by recording something of the achievements of those who had
contributed to the intellectual, industrial and commercial growth of the
country, as well as of its political leaders. The purpose remained the
same in the second volume published in 1888, and is once more the
impulse of the present book.

The vast majority of those whose careers were recorded in 1886 have
passed away; and the same is true of those who figured in the second
volume of the series. Consequently, the earlier issues of
“Representative Canadians” grow every day more precious, for, in many
cases, they contain the sole records of men who initiated great
enterprises or furthered important movements which have left a lasting
mark on the history of Canada. We cannot but think that the reader who,
thirty or forty years hence, may chance to scan the pages of the present
volume will gather a very vivid picture of Canada as it was in one of
the crucial periods of the world’s affairs—a picture in which the
characters of those Canadians who lived and “carried on” through the
years of the greatest war in all history may be discerned in the records
of their lives. There is hardly a page in this book into which the war
does not enter directly or indirectly in some form or other, by way of
allusions to services rendered, bereavements endured, or honours gained
on the field of battle. In that sense the 1919 volume must remain
unique, and a mine of useful information for students in future
generations.

Generally speaking, in comparing the biographies of the Canadians of
to-day with those of 1886 and 1888, the reader gains a sense of this
country’s continuous expansion. The present century has witnessed a
marvellous development in the Canadian West, so that in these pages we
find numerous records showing not merely the commercial, but the
intellectual, progress of the Provinces West of the Great Lakes—stories
of brilliant careers built up by men who were mere children in the East
when the first volume was published. The reader will also note in the
biographies of business men which abound in these pages, the
ever-increasing scale on which Canadian commerce and enterprise
everywhere is conducted, so that what seemed large in 1886 is relatively
small to-day. Though some of the men whose names figure in the index are
of less importance than others, all play their part in our complex and
vigorous social life, and the story of their progress and fortunes
cannot be really tedious to any sympathetic student of humanity.

                           CANADIAN BIOGRAPHY

=Borden, Rt. Hon. Sir Robert Laird, P.C., K.C.M.G., K.C., LL.D.=,
Premier of Canada (Ottawa, Ont.), eldest son of Andrew Borden and Eunice
Laird, was born at Grand Pré, Nova Scotia, on June 26, 1854. He was
educated at Acadia Villa Academy, Horton, and for a time a Professor in
Glenwood Institute, N.J. His great-great-grandfather went to King’s
County, Nova Scotia, with early settlers from New England, in 1760, and
upon returning to Massachusetts gave his land in Nova Scotia to his son,
the great-grandfather of the subject of this sketch. Upon returning to
Nova Scotia, Sir Robert studied law and was called to the Bar in 1878.
He first practised at Kentville, N.S., and later moved to Halifax,
succeeding the late Sir John Thompson, then Prime Minister of Canada, in
the firm of Thompson, Graham and Tupper. Before removing to Ottawa he
was head of the law firm of Borden, Ritchie & Chisholm, of Halifax, and
for ten years was President of the Nova Scotia Barristers’ Society. He
was made a Q.C. in 1900; an Honorary LL.D. of Queen’s University in
1903; an Honorary LL.D., St. Francis Xavier University in 1905; an
Honorary LL.D. of McGill University in 1913. In 1896 he was elected to
the House of Commons from Halifax in the General Elections, and
re-elected in 1900, but was an unsuccessful candidate at the General
Elections in 1904. Upon the retirement of Edward Kidd, M.P., for
Carleton, Ont., he was elected by acclamation in his stead at the
by-election held on February 4, 1905, and was re-elected by a large
majority at the general elections in 1908, when he was also elected in
Halifax, N.S. He later resigned his Carleton seat, preferring to
represent Halifax. At the General Elections of 1911, he was again
returned for Halifax, and continued to represent that constituency up to
the present time (1918). On February 6, 1901, he was chosen leader of
the Conservative Party in the House of Commons, and upon the resignation
of Sir Wilfrid Laurier and his Cabinet on October 6, 1911, following the
defeat of the Liberal Government on the question of Reciprocity with the
United States, he was sent for by His Excellency Earl Grey and was
entrusted with the task of forming a Cabinet. With a very large majority
at his disposal, he found the task an easy one, and was successful in
gathering around him men who have since carried on the government of the
country in one of the most critical periods of its existence. At the
time the first Borden government assumed office the world war was
unthought of except as a vague speculation, which few students of world
finance and world politics believed would ever become a fact, and the
new Premier did not foresee that before him lay the most difficult task
that had ever confronted a Canadian Government. In the summer of 1914
the conflict which ultimately developed into a war between the Central
Empires and most of the other civilized powers, came like a bolt from
the blue. On August 4, 1914, there was great curiosity in the
chancelleries of Europe as to whether the overseas dominions of the
British Empire would stand behind Great Britain. Germany, on the day she
started the war, believed that they would not, and it was prophesied in
Berlin that Canada would seek separation from the Empire. Sir Robert
Borden at once gave the answer by placing the entire resources of the
Dominion at the disposal of the Motherland; and on receiving an
intimation from the late Lord Kitchener, that men were the first
necessity, immediately called Parliament together to vote the necessary
money. His government commenced the training and equipment of a first
volunteer expeditionary force of 35,000, with provision for its further
extension at need. This expeditionary force was partly trained at
Valcartier camp, Quebec, and partly at Salisbury Plains, England, and
first went into action at the second battle of Ypres in the spring of
1915. In the words of Viscount French, at that time Commander-in-Chief
of the British forces in France, it “saved the situation” and barred the
way to the Channel Ports from the Germans. In 1915 Sir Robert, who had
been honored with the title of G.C.M.G. shortly before the outbreak of
the conflict, visited Great Britain and France and, convincing himself
that the struggle would be very long and difficult, pledged Canada to
provide an aggregate of 500,000 trained men should the need arise. He
and his government also made arrangements whereby Canadian manufacturers
should engage largely in the production of munitions, the credits for
such contracts being financed by the Canadian administration. The same
policy was pursued in connection with contracts for food supplies, with
the result that throughout the war there was a continued trade expansion
and financial opulence that enabled Canada to make sacrifices that would
otherwise have been impossible to her. During his visits to the front
Sir Robert kept himself fully in touch with the needs of the Canadian
army, and resolved to make it a first consideration in all his policies.
A trip to Great Britain and France in the early part of 1917 convinced
him that, in view of the dark outlook for peace, it would be necessary
for Canada to adopt the policy of conscription, which had already been
reluctantly adopted in Great Britain by Mr. Asquith, and had become the
policy of the United States, which had recently entered the war. It was
clear to Sir Robert that this policy could only be effectively imposed
by consent of both parties in the House of Commons, and on his return to
Canada in May, 1917, he announced conscription as his policy and an
abandonment of party government. He was at first stoutly opposed both in
the ranks of his own party and by his political opponents. Nevertheless,
after long and patient negotiations he was successful in winning
practically the entire body of English-speaking Liberals to his way of
thinking, and conscription carried in the House of Commons in the latter
part of July, 1917, by the greatest majority ever given so momentous a
measure. He then proceeded to form a Union Government almost equally
representative of Conservatives and Liberals. Early in December of 1917
this government, with Sir Robert as Prime Minister, appealed to the
people, and was supported by almost the entire mass of English-speaking
constituencies, giving him the largest majority that any political
leader has ever enjoyed in this country. As a result of the adoption of
conscription, Canada was enabled by the time peace was declared to
fulfil her pledge of sending 500,000 men to aid in the war against
autocracy—a contribution which has made this country famous throughout
the world. Already, on January 1, 1912, Sir Robert had been sworn in as
a member of the Imperial Privy Council, the highest office that up to
that time had been held in the Motherland by a Canadian. On his arrival
in London in June, 1918, he was invited by the Prime Minister, Hon.
David Lloyd-George to become a member of the Imperial War Cabinet, a
post which he held during the duration of the war. This was followed in
November of 1918 by an invitation to become one of Great Britain’s
Imperial representatives at the negotiations preliminary to and
coincident with the Peace Conference to resolve the disasters of the war
and at once proceeded overseas. Sir Robert’s Imperial services have been
such, and his legal attainments are so well known that at the time of
writing his elevation to the peerage as a colonial representative on the
legal committee of the Privy Council, which is the Court of Appeal for
the whole Empire, is being strongly advocated in the Motherland. In his
private relations Sir Robert is greatly beloved, and though his duties
have brought him in contact with all the leading figures of Great
Britain, France and the United States, he is a thorough democrat in
bearing. His favorite recreation is golf and he has played with many
world-famous statesmen, though he does not claim to be a champion. He is
an Anglican in religion and a member of many clubs on both sides of the
Atlantic. In September of 1889 he married Laura, daughter of the late T.
H. Bond, of Halifax, and never fails to acknowledge the great aid and
assistance that has been rendered him by Lady Borden in building up his
illustrious career. They reside at 201 Wurtemburg St., Ottawa.

=Laurier, the late Rt. Hon. Sir Wilfrid, P.C., G.C.M.G., K.C., D.C.L.
(Oxon.), LL.D.= (Ottawa, Ont.), son of the late Carolus Laurier, P.L.S.,
and his wife, Marcelle Martineau; born at St. Lin, Quebec, on November
20, 1841, and educated at mixed schools in his native parish and at
L’Assomption College. As a law student he entered the office of the late
Hon. R. Laflamme in 1860, and studied at McGill University; received
B.C.L. in 1864 and was called to the Bar in the same year; was appointed
a Q.C. in 1880, and became head of the law firm of Laurier & Lavergne.
In the earlier years of his professional career he edited and
contributed to several newspapers. In May 13, 1868, he married Miss Zoe
Lafontaine. He was elected to the Legislative Assembly for Drummond and
Arthabaska in 1871, and resigned to contest the same riding for the
House of Commons at the general elections in 1874, and was elected; was
sworn in a Privy Councillor and appointed Minister of Inland Revenue in
the Mackenzie administration, on October 8, 1877, and on going back for
re-election, was defeated by D. O. Bourbeau, who obtained a majority of
forty. Later he was elected for Quebec East, a seat vacated by I.
Thibaudeau, and was re-elected for the same Riding at the general
elections of 1878, 1882, 1887, 1891, 1896 and 1900, and also elected for
Saskatchewan, N.W.T., at the general elections of 1896; was re-elected
to the House of Commons at general elections of 1904 for Quebec East and
Wright, and elected to sit for Quebec East; in 1908 was re-elected for
Quebec East, and was also returned for the City of Ottawa, and again
elected to sit for Quebec East; in 1911 he was elected for both Quebec
East and Soulanges; and in 1918 for Quebec East. In October, 1878, he
resigned with the Mackenzie Government, and was elected leader of the
Liberal Party in the House of Commons in 1887. He issued a call for a
Dominion Liberal Convention in 1893, which was held at Ottawa. Upon the
defeat of the Tupper Government at the general elections, June 23, 1896,
he was called on by Lord Aberdeen, Governor-General, to form a ministry
on July 8, 1896, on which date Sir Charles Tupper resigned office; was
sworn in as President of the Privy Council, July 11, 1896, and formed
his Ministry, July 13, 1896. He was appointed by a sub-committee of the
Privy Council to arrange for the settlement of the Manitoba School
Question and an agreement was reached in November of the same year. On
the occasion of the celebration of Her Majesty Queen Victoria’s Diamond
Jubilee at London, Eng., June, 1897, he represented Canada, and was
created a Knight Grand Cross of the Most Distinguished Order of St.
Michael and St. George; was received in audience by the Sovereign and
accorded the leading place in the great Jubilee State Procession of all
the Colonial dignitaries. Oxford and Cambridge Universities conferred
upon him the degree of D.C.L. (hon.) during this visit. He was sworn in
an Imperial Privy Councillor July 6, 1897; was made an honorary member
of the Cobden Club, and received from it a gold medal in recognition of
his services in the cause of international free exchange; was presented
by the President of France with the Star of a Grand Officer of the
legion of Honour, at Havre, July 29, 1897, being the highest but one of
that order; was received in audience by His Holiness the Pope, August
12, 1897. While in England he succeeded in securing Her Majesty’s
Government’s assent to the denunciation of the commercial treaties with
Germany and Belgium, which stood in the way of Canada’s new tariff,
extending a preference to the United Kingdom. On his return to Canada he
was accorded public receptions at Quebec, Montreal, Toronto and Ottawa,
and received from Toronto and Queen’s Universities the honorary degrees
of LL.D. In November, 1897, he went to Washington in the interest of
better relations between the two countries, and was a member of the
Joint Commission which met at Quebec, August 23, 1898, to discuss
questions affecting jointly Great Britain, Canada and the United States.
He welcomed the present King, then Duke of Cornwall and York, to Canada
in September, 1901, and accompanied the Royal Party through the
Dominion; was invited, and attended, the Coronation of King Edward VII,
in 1902, sailing June 14, arriving in Liverpool June 21, and in London,
June 22. The Coronation, fixed for June 26, was postponed on June 24,
but took place on August 9. On June 30 he attended a Colonial Conference
at London, and on July 26 received the freedom of the City of Edinburgh,
and was honored with the degree of LL.D. by the Edinburgh University. He
was entertained by the City of Glasgow, July 28, visited the continent,
and sailed for Canada on October 7, arriving at Quebec, October 17, and
at Ottawa, October 18, receiving a great civic welcome at the City Hall.
On New Year’s Day, 1904, he was presented by His Excellency the
Governor-General, with the Fenian Raid medal for services as a volunteer
in 1866. In 1907 he attended the Imperial Conference at London, Eng., as
a representative of Canada, and was accorded the freedom of London,
Bristol, Liverpool and other cities; and in 1911 he attended the
Imperial Conference in England and represented Canada at the coronation
of King George and Queen Mary. Following the defeat of his Party at the
polls on September 21, 1911, on October 6 he tendered the resignation of
himself and Cabinet to Earl Grey, and advised His Excellency to call
upon Mr. R. L. Borden, to form a Cabinet. From that date until his death
on Feb. 17, 1919, he continued to lead the Liberal Party, and in 1917
celebrated his seventy-fifth birthday. He again led his party in the
general election of December, 1917, but was defeated owing to the fact
that many followers had parted company with him on the issue of
Conscription. Sir Wilfrid’s end came suddenly as a result of an effusion
of blood to the brain. He was stricken while preparing to go to church
on Sunday, Feb. 16, and passed away the following afternoon. The death
of no Canadian had previously evoked such tributes as were printed and
uttered, not only in Canada, but throughout the British Empire and the
United States. His remains were accorded the honor of a State funeral in
Ottawa on Saturday, Feb. 22, 1919, which was the most impressive
function of its kind known on any continent since the death of Lincoln.

=Ames, Sir Herbert B., K.B., LL.D., M.P.= (Montreal, Que.), born June
27, 1863, at Montreal, of which city he has been a life-long resident.
He is the only son of the late Evan Fisher Ames (who founded the shoe
manufacturing concern of Ames, Holden & Company in 1856), and of
Caroline Matilda Brown, his wife, who was a native of New York City. Mr.
E. F. Ames came to Canada from Conway, Mass., which district he
represented in the Massachusetts Legislature in 1852. He established
himself in Montreal, and became one of the leading Canadian
manufacturers. Sir Herbert Ames was educated in the schools of Montreal,
subsequently entering Amherst College at Amherst, Mass., graduating from
there with the degree of B.A. in 1885, and having had conferred on him
the further title of LL.D. in 1915. When in college he was a member of
the Alpha Phi Fraternity. In August, 1885, after leaving Amherst, he
entered the firm of Ames, Holden & Company, at Montreal, remaining in
that business until 1893. He next interested himself in municipal reform
and became President of an organization of young men known as the
Volunteer Electoral League, which body was largely instrumental in
bringing about the reformation of the City Council. In 1898 Mr. Ames was
elected a member of the Montreal City Council for St. Antoine Ward, and
served his constituency for eight years. During that period he was a
member of the Police Commission, of the Road Commission and for four
years served as Chairman of the Board of Health. In 1895 Mr. Ames was
named a member of the Council of Public Instruction of the Province of
Quebec, which body supervises the entire school system of the province.
Mr. Ames was first elected a member of the House of Commons, Canada, in
1904, having a majority of 650. In 1908 he was again elected by 850 of a
majority, and in 1911 elected for the third time by a majority of over
2,000; again re-elected in December, 1917. On the formation of the
Borden Government, in 1911, Mr. Ames was appointed to the important
position of chairman of the Select Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce, to which all bills pertaining to Banks, Trust and Loan and
Insurance Companies are referred for examination and report. In 1903 he
was a member of the National Committee to entertain the Chambers of
Commerce of the Empire, and with them travelled throughout the Dominion.
In 1909, as representative of the Montreal Board of Trade, Mr. Ames
attended the meeting of the Chambers of Commerce at Sydney, Australia.
He has travelled extensively throughout Australia, Japan, Egypt, India,
Europe, the United States and West Indies, and has given much time and
attention to the discussion of trade questions, tariff and treaties with
other countries. In 1896 he wrote and published a monograph entitled
“The City Below the Hill,” being a sociological study of the District of
the City of Montreal, in which such questions as wages, rents, health
conditions, etc., were carefully received. At the request of the
Department of Commerce and Labor of the United States Government, Mr.
Ames prepared an article on the same subject which appeared in the
journals of this department. At the present time Sir Herbert Ames is a
Director and Vice-President of the Ames, Holden, McCready Company. He is
also one of the three gentlemen composing the Canadian Board of the
Gresham Life Insurance Company, and also a Director of the Dominion
Guarantee Company. He is a member of the Mount Royal Club, the Montreal
Club, the Montreal Curling Club, the University Club of Montreal, the
Rideau Club, Ottawa. On May 19, 1890, Mr. Ames was married to Louise
Marion Kennedy, daughter of Sir John Kennedy, C.E., of Montreal, and
they occupy a residence on the slopes of Mount Royal. He is an elder in
the Presbyterian Church, a Director in the Y.M.C.A., a governor in
several benevolent institutions. At the outbreak of the great War, Mr.
Ames was asked by His Royal Highness, the Governor-General of Canada, to
assume the position of Honorary Secretary of the National Canadian
Patriotic Fund, which provides for the wives and dependent relatives of
soldiers serving in the armies of the Allies. On behalf of the Fund he
has visited all parts of Canada, speaking and organizing, and the marked
success to his initiative and effort. Through this great national
benefaction there will have been raised and expended during the war
period no less a sum than $45,000,000. On June 3, 1915, Mr. Ames had
conferred upon him the Honor of Knighthood by His Majesty the King, and
in 1916 was made a Knight of Grace of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem
in England. On December 1, 1918, the Government of Canada created by
Order-in-Council a National War Savings Committee for the encouragement
of thrift and the promotion of investment of small savings in government
securities. Of this Committee Sir Herbert Ames has been appointed
Chairman.

=Robertson, John Ross=, journalist. The direct descendant of Duncan R.,
chief of the clan of Robertson of Strowan, 1347; eldest son of the late
John Robertson, wholesale dry goods merchant, Toronto, and Margaret R.,
daughter of Hector Sinclair, Stornoway, Island of Lewis, Scotland. He
was born in Toronto, Dec. 28, 1841, and educated at Upper Canada
College; married, 1st, in 1871, Maria Louisa (d. Aug., 1886), daughter
of Edward Earle Matthew Gillbee, Northamptonshire, Eng., grandson of the
late Rev. Dr. Edward Gillbee, Vicar of Barby, near Rugby, descendant of
the noted Anthony Gilby, one of the translators of the first edition of
the Geneva or “Breeches” Bible, 1560; 2ndly, 1888, Jessie Elizabeth,
daughter of George B. Holland, a prominent insurance man of Toronto.
While still at college he occupied his spare hours in acquiring a
knowledge of the printer’s craft, and was a fairly rapid compositor;
commenced a small office which he established in his father’s residence,
John St., Toronto, and with a few fonts of type he issued to the boys at
Upper Canada College a paper under the name of the “College Times,”
which later took the name of the “Boys’ Times,” a monthly publication
that existed 1857-60. He also published in succession to the “Boys’
Times,” during a year at the Model Grammar School, a newsy paper for
boys called “Young Canada.” Picking up a general knowledge of setting
type and small job work in city offices, his face was a familiar one in
the old “Christian Guardian” office, where occasionally he used to work
off odd jobs, the composition of which he did in his own office; in the
“Globe” Office, where in 1859, when opportunity offered, he sometimes
used to feed one of the Hoe single cylinder presses when printing the
inner pages of the four-page “Globe,” for the inside was always printed
the afternoon before the morning issue; in the “Leader,” where he at
times worked off on a small job cylinder Hoe press, the “Grumbler,” the
weekly that he issued in 1860; the following year he equipped a
newspaper and job office, and issued “Sporting Life,” the first paper in
Canada to be devoted to athletic sports, and subsequently continued the
publication of the “Grumbler,” a weekly satirical paper, at one time
edited by W. J. Rattray, W. A. Foster, and the late Chief Justice Thomas
Moss. He worked on the reportorial and advertising staff of the
“Leader,” when Charles Lindsey and Charles Belford were editors and
Ephraim Roden, City Editor, continuing at the same time the management
of his printing office. He also issued for a year, Robertson’s Canadian
Railway Guide, the first of its kind in Canada, and early in 1865 joined
the Toronto “Globe” staff as city Editor, in May, 1866, becoming one of
the founders of the “Daily Telegraph,” a journal that had a high
reputation among the newspapers of Canada. Owing to political
complications it ceased publication in 1872. Prior to this, in December,
1869, Mr. Robertson, then of the “Daily Telegraph,” made a trip to the
North-West, accompanied by Mr. Robert Cunningham of the “Globe.” They
travelled by rail from Toronto to the end of steel at St. Cloud, Minn.,
and there with a French half-breed guide and a two-horse farmer’s
sleigh, fully equipped, began a journey of about 400 miles over the
prairie. Snow storms raged and the thermometer ran from zero to 20
below. The travellers camped every night in the woods along the Red
River, and arrived in Fort Garry after a perilous journey of ten days,
to be locked up by the so-called “President” Riel, in Fort Garry for a
week, and only allowed out to see their friends in the town, under a
guard. They both secured interesting information, but were ordered out
of the territory, as Riel thought they were “dangerous characters,” so
they left Fort Garry for Pembina, U.S., the boundary post, one day when
the thermometer was about 40 below zero. They declared they would not do
the trip again for the whole North-West. Mr. Robertson, after the “Daily
Telegraph” ceased publication, proceeded to London, Eng., where for
three years he acted as resident correspondent and business
representative of the Toronto “Daily Globe.” On his return to Canada,
1875, he assumed the business management of the “Nation,” edited by the
late Prof. Goldwin Smith. It is said that during his managership of the
“Nation,” his friend, Mr. Goldwin Smith asked his opinion as to the
opportunities offered for an independent daily evening paper in Toronto,
and that this conversation led up to the establishment of the “Evening
Telegram,” which first saw light in April, 1876. It is said to be the
only daily paper in Canada that has paid its way from the start. Mr.
Robertson continued to conduct it until his death, May 31, 1918. “The
immediate success of this paper,” said the “Globe,” in a sketch of his
career published during his lifetime, “is ample evidence that he has
graduated from a good school of journalism. Neither accident or luck had
aught to do with his success. He launched out in new and original lines,
and the good fortune that attended his efforts was the outcome of his
energy, enthusiasm and experience, reinforced by a persistence and
resource that would admit of no failure; it is these qualities that he
brings to his every undertaking, and on the “Globe” he left behind him a
reputation that is worthy of his later achievements.” This was publicly
demonstrated by his Masonic career and his management of that great
charity—the Hospital for Sick Children. From the first he has held high
rank in the Masonic order. He entered the Craft in 1867, and was W.M. of
his Mother Lodge, King Solomon’s, in 1880-1, and of Mimico, No. 359, in
1879-80. After having served successively as Grand Senior Warden, as
District Grand Master of the Toronto District in 1886, he became in 1890
Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Canada, and was subsequently chosen
Grand First Principal of the Grand Royal Arch Chapter of Canada, 1894-5,
and Provincial Grand Prior, Ontario Centre, Sovereign Great Priory of
Canadian Knights Templar, 1882; was Grand Representative of the Grand
Lodge of England in Canada, having been appointed to succeed Sir John A.
Macdonald in that office on the latter’s death, 1891; indeed, every
honor at the disposal of his fellow-craftsmen had been accorded him. In
September, 1902, in commemoration of the coronation of His Majesty King
Edward, the Duke of Connaught (q.v.) then and now Grand Master, was
pleased to confer the honorary rank of Past Grand Warden of England upon
several eminent personages, including the subject of this sketch. For
many years Mr. Robertson was president of the Canadian Copyright
Association and rendered important services in that regard, and also
Vice-President and President of the Canadian Associated Press, and Hon.
President of the Toronto Press Club. He was present, with his wife, by
invitation, in Westminster Abbey, at the coronation of King Edward and
Queen Alexandra. As an author of Masonic works, Mr. Robertson is well
known, having written the “History of the Degree of the Cryptic Rite in
Canada,” etc. (1888); “History of the Knights Templar of Canada, from
the Foundation of the Order to the Present Time” (1890); “Talks with
Craftsmen” (1893); “Freemasonry in Canada,” 2 vols., 1,000 pages each
(1899). He was a contributor to the U.C. College Memorial Volume, 1893,
edited the “Diary of Mrs. John Graves Simcoe, wife of the First
Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada, 1792-6” (1911), as a press notice
said, “The book of the year, a superb work,” and the author and compiler
of “Robertson’s Landmarks of Toronto” (7 vols.). In 1888 the ambulance
system in Toronto was unsatisfactory, and with a view to making it
efficient, he imported from London, Eng., a modern ambulance, fully
equipped, and presented it to the city. There are about sixty ambulances
in Canada made from this model. The presentation marked a new era in
this branch of humane work. He later gave a collection of 4,000 Canadian
historical pictures to the Toronto Public Library, the largest
collection of its kind in the world, valued at $150,000. In January,
1917, he acquired and presented to the Public Library a magnificent
ornithological collection of birds and game of Canada, done in
water-color by William Pope, an English sportsman and artist, who
resided for forty years at Port Ryerse, Ont. This collection of
water-colors is pronounced by eminent Canadian biologists to be equal of
and in some respects superior to, the work of Audubon. Mr. Robertson
later added to this another collection of Canadian birds, exquisite
reproductions in color of hundreds of birds that are not in the Pope
Collection, so that the entire collection is unparalleled in Canada. He
founded and gave three magnificent silver cups, made by eminent British
silversmiths, from special patterns, for the promotion of cricket,
hockey and bowling; but it was as chairman of the Board of Trustees of
the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, that he will be most gratefully
remembered. For thirty-five years he carried the chief burden of this
important charitable institution, bringing to its needs not only much
money of his own, but aiding it with the full force of his powers as a
financier and organizer. He took an active part in the management and
visited the Hospital every day. His gifts to the Hospital amounted to
about half a million dollars during his lifetime, for he completely
equipped the Hospital buildings on College St. and on Elizabeth St., and
built and founded, in connection with the Hospital, the Lakeside Home
for Little Children, at Lighthouse Point, Toronto Island, with an
accommodation for 250 patients and an entire hospital equipment; here,
during the summer months, the suffering little ones are won back to
health and strength with the aid of the cool breezes which sweep across
Lake Ontario. Included in his benefactions to the Hospital he erected,
equipped and presented to the Hospital (as a memorial of his first wife)
a five-storey nurses’ brick residence, containing 125 rooms, which has
been declared to be the most perfect building of its kind ever erected;
in July, 1911, he presented to the Heather Club an extension to the
pavilion for tubercular children in connection with the Lakeside Home.
He built and established a complete plant for the pasteurization of
milk, on the Hospital grounds, College St., Toronto, the only one of its
kind in the Dominion. By his will the whole of his estate will
ultimately go to this philanthropy. He was an all-round amateur athlete,
and has been sometimes called “The Father of Amateur Hockey in Ontario”;
was President of the Ontario Hockey Association, 1899-1905. He sat for
East Toronto in 1896-1900 in the House of Commons as an Independent
Conservative, pledged to oppose any Government which would attempt to
establish separate schools in Manitoba, to support the “National
Policy,” and to vote for the general good of the country. According to
Sir Charles Tupper (q.v.) he was in all respects “a model member,” and a
devoted Imperialist. In religion he was a Presbyterian. In February,
1917, Mr. Robertson was offered in the New Year’s honors a knighthood
and a senatorship, both of which honors he gratefully declined. A
well-known politician said, “It is the first time in the history of
Canada that anyone declined a knighthood and a senatorship in the same

=Hearst, Hon. Sir William Howard, K.C.M.G., K.C., M.P.P.=, Prime
Minister of the Province of Ontario, was born on February 15, 1864, in
the township of Arran, Bruce County, Ontario, the son of William and
Margaret (McFadden) Hearst. His father was a farmer, and the subject of
this sketch was educated at the public schools of Arran Township and
later at Collingwood Collegiate Institute. Subsequently he studied for
the legal profession at Osgoode Hall, Toronto, and was called to the Bar
of Ontario in 1888. He commenced the practice of law in Sault Ste.
Marie, Ont., where he became prominent in municipal affairs and active
as a speaker in the Conservative interest. He was an unsuccessful
candidate in Algoma East in 1894, but in the Ontario Legislative
elections in 1902 he helped to organize a group of newly defined
constituencies in Northern Ontario for Mr. (afterward Sir) James P.
Whitney, and by his effective methods largely assisted in placing them
in the Conservative column. When the Whitney Government was formed in
1905 Mr. Hearst was appointed Government agent in connection with the
guarantee loan furnished to the Lake Superior Corporation, under the
provisions of which the Government had a voice in the management of the
corporation until the loan should be liquidated. In this capacity Mr.
Hearst proved a business success but resigned the office in 1908 to
contest the riding of Sault Ste. Marie for the Ontario Legislature. He
was successful and in September, 1911, when Hon. Frank Cochrane resigned
the Portfolio of Forests and Mines to become Minister of Railways and
Canals in the first Borden cabinet, Sir James Whitney tendered the
vacancy in his cabinet to Mr. Hearst. The latter accepted and was
re-elected by acclamation by his constituents, whom he has ever since
continued to represent. On the death of Sir James Whitney in 1914, he
was asked to form a Government, all his former colleagues accepting
office under him. He was sworn in as Prime Minister and President of the
Council on October 2, 1914, this being practically the last official act
of Sir John Gibson, as Lieutenant-Governor. Following the death of Hon.
James Duff in December, 1916, he also assumed the post of Minister of
Agriculture, retaining it for two years until the elevation of Hon.
George Henry to the cabinet in 1918. In connection with his profession
as a lawyer he was created a K.C. in 1908 and was elected a bencher of
the Law Society of Upper Canada in 1912. On February 13, 1917, he was
created a Knight Commander of the Order of St. Michael and St. George.
The Premiership of Sir William Hearst has been marked by energetic
administration and progressive legislation. He took office at a time of
peculiar difficulty in Canadian affairs, when the great war had been in
progress for two months and when it was becoming evident that it would
be necessary for a vast and united effort if it was to be successfully
prosecuted. Perhaps his most radical step was his act of 1916, to
prohibit the sale of intoxicating liquors throughout the province of
Ontario. Subsequent orders-in-Council by the Federal government gave
this act the effect of absolute prohibition. In 1917 he introduced and
carried an act to confer the Parliamentary franchise on women. Under his
leadership a comprehensive measure previously enacted providing for
compensation to workmen for injuries was put into successful operation
and extended. An important measure of his provides for loans to
settlers, and he has also taken practical steps to deal with the housing
problem. The policy of Sir James Whitney and Sir Adam Beck of government
control and operation of the water powers of the province, known as the
Hydro-Electric system has been amplified under Sir William Hearst. In
connection with the war he visited the battlefront to personally
ascertain the needs of the situation. Under his administration the
Orpington Military Hospital in England was built as the gift of the
people of Ontario. As Minister of Agriculture he organized measures for
increased food production to meet the needs of soldiers and civilians
overseas; and is taking active measures to assist in reconstruction, by
helping returned soldiers to settle on the land. In religion Sir William
is a Methodist. On July 21, 1891, he married Isabella Jane Dunkin of
Sault Ste. Marie by whom he has four children, Lieutenant Howard Vernon
Hearst and Lieutenant Irving Hearst, both of whom are on active war
service; and Misses Isabel and Evelyn Hearst. Sir William resides at
Toronto.

the son of Joseph and Mary Meighen, of St. Mary’s, Ont. He was educated
at St. Mary’s Collegiate Institute and Toronto University; received
degree B.A. (Tor.), 1896; graduated with honors in mathematics. Taught
High School, Caledonia, Ont., 1897-98. After graduating as a Barrister,
he entered business for himself, 1902, and built up a large practice at
Portage la Prairie. Bencher Manitoba Law Society since 1908; Bencher of
Upper Canada Law Society since 1914. Having a capacity for public life,
at the solicitation of his friends, he accepted the nomination as
Conservative candidate for the Constituency of Portage la Prairie, Man.,
and was elected by a majority of 250. In 1904 Mr. Crawford, Liberal, had
been elected by a majority of 358. In the general elections, September
21, 1911, when the Laurier Administration was defeated at the polls on
the question of Reciprocity with the United States, Mr. Meighen was
again elected by a majority of 675 over his opponent R. Patterson. When
the position of Solicitor-General became vacant, June 26, 1913, Sir
Robert Borden invited Mr. Meighen to accept that office, and at a
bye-election held July 19, 1913, he was returned by acclamation. In
August, 1917, he became Secretary of State for Canada and Minister of
Mines, and as such devised and installed the organizations in Canada and
overseas for the holding of the war election of that year. On the
formation of the Union Government in the autumn of 1917 he accepted the
portfolio of Minister of the Interior, and was re-elected by a handsome
majority at the general elections which ensued. As a parliamentarian he
has been a success, and is held in high esteem by members on both sides
of the House. As a debater he is considered one of the ablest, and
always commands the respect of his colleagues when he rises to speak on
any important subject. Mr. Meighen was married June 1, 1904, to Jessie
Isabel Cox, to whom were born three children, Theodore Roosvelt Meighen
(1905), Maxwell Charles Gordon Meighen (1908), and Lillian Meighen

=Cockshutt, William Foster, M.P.=, and Financial Agent (Brantford,
Ont.), is the son of I. Cockshutt, merchant of Brantford, and E. Foster
Cockshutt, was born in Brantford, October, 1855, and educated at the
Brantford and Galt Collegiate Institutes. Mr. Cockshutt’s chief public
efforts have been exercised in the direction of Imperial Unity and
Empire Trade development. He has been associated largely with Boards of
Trade and has attended several Congresses of the Associated Boards in
London, England, Montreal and Sydney, Australia, and in this direction
has been able to exercise considerable influence in Empire trade
co-operation. In the year 1909 he visited in this connection the
Commonwealth of Australia, making a very extensive tour of that great
country, and delivering addresses at all the important centres on the
theme of Empire Trade and Defence, and received much credit for the work
accomplished there. He also made an extensive tour of India, visiting
most of the cities of that great member of the Empire, and studying the
conditions of the country as well as trade matters and has taken part in
two extended campaigns in Great Britain, addressing many large meetings
at the important centres, including London, Manchester, Newcastle,
Portsmouth, Bournemouth, Torquay and many other towns and cities, for
which he was honored by letter from the then leader of the opposition,
the Honorable Arthur Balfour. Mr. Cockshutt was a member of the first
Hydro-Electric Commission of Ontario, appointed by the Municipalities
and labored in that work for nearly three years. The report of the
Commission has been a standard reference for development in this line
ever since, and was really the basis of the development that has taken
place more recently at Niagara Falls. He has travelled in most of the
great countries of Europe, made many tours in the United States and the
West Indies and Mexico, as well as having visited all the principal
cities of the Dominion and has addressed meetings in a great number of
them. He was first elected to the House of Commons in 1904, where he
served until 1908, being defeated in that year and re-elected in 1911,
and is at present serving throughout the present long Parliament. He is
ex-President of the Cockshutt Plow Co.; has been six times a delegate to
Chambers of Commerce of the Empire and is connected with a large number
of industrial enterprises, particularly in Brantford and also in other
centres, and has served on many industrial boards. In 1891, married M.
T. Ashton, daughter of Rev. Robert Ashton of Brantford, Principal of the
Mohawk Institute and has six children, Ashton, George, Eric, Maude,
Clarence and Phyllis. In politics he is an Independent Conservative and
is a member of the Anglican Church; has been a representative of the
Church of England at many important gatherings and a member of the Huron
Synod for close on to twenty-five years, been elected and re-elected to
the Provincial General Synod on many occasions and is still an active
member of all these Church organizations; is also Chairman of the
Orphanage situated on the outskirts of Brantford, known as the Jane
Laycock School; has taken considerable interest in local hospital work.
Mr. Cockshutt had the honor of being the official representative of
Brantford at the funeral of King Edward the Seventh; is Hon. Colonel of
the 125th Battalion, C.E.F., and is a remote relative of the late
Florence Nightingale, the distinguished woman who did such great work
for the British Army during the Crimean War and was one of the first
women to relieve soldiers of their sufferings on the battlefield. Mr.
Cockshutt took great interest in the recruiting of the 125th Battalion
at present overseas and has the honor of being the father of three sons,
all of whom are serving in the army at present and have all reached the
front at least once. His son, Major Ashton Cockshutt, now of the 125th
but formerly of the 10th Battalion, 1st Contingent, was a fully
qualified Lieutenant in the 103rd Calgary Rifles when the war broke out
and immediately enlisted and went overseas with the first Contingent,
training during the winter at Salisbury Plain, crossing to France in the
early spring, saw heavy fighting at St. Julien, Festubert, and Givenchy,
was wounded on June 6, 1915, and after convalescing at various military
hospitals was given furlough back to Canada and after a long hard
struggle regained his health and immediately re-enlisted with the 125th
Battalion and is now serving at Bramshott Camp. Another son, Lieut.
George Cockshutt, also enlisted early in the war with the 19th Overseas
Battalion, was a qualified Officer of the Dufferin Rifles, he served the
19th at the front for many months and was invalided home in September,
1916, owing to ear trouble and at the present time is serving with the
205th Machine Gun Section, and now overseas with 1st Tank Battalion. The
third son, Lieut. Eric Cockshutt, was at one time Captain of the Cadet
Corps of Upper Canada College, Toronto, and upon going to McGill
University, Montreal, later joined the Officers Training Corps of that
University, was accepted as a candidate at the Royal Artillery School at
Kingston, March, 1915, and after duly qualifying, trained at Petawawa,
going overseas from there with a draft, took further training at Ross
Barracks and Woolwich and then crossed over to France and served with
the First Divisional Artillery, First Canadian Brigade, and is at
present serving with the 2nd Howitzers. Mr. Cockshutt is a member of the
Brantford Golf and Country Club, the National Club, Toronto, and also
connected with the Empire Club and Imperial Institute. His recreations
include golf, tennis and skating, and he has spent many summers in the
Highlands of Canada occupying an extensive tract of land on the shores
of Lake of Bays.

=Jetté, The Hon. Sir Louis=, Chief Justice and late Lieutenant-Governor,
was born at L’Assomption, P.Q., on January 15, 1836. He is the son of
the late Amable Jetté, who married Miss Caroline Gauffreau, the daughter
of a wealthy planter of Guadaloupe, in the West Indies. Finishing the
full course of study at the College of L’Assomption, he became a member
of the Provincial Bar, establishing himself as a legal practitioner in
the city of Montreal, where in a few years he came to be recognized as
an astute advocate as well as a prospective candidate for political
honors. In 1870 his legal fame was enhanced by the part he took
professionally in the famous Guibord Case, and by his service before the
Privy Council in England in behalf of the Provincial Government of
Quebec. At length, in 1872, he was elected member for Montreal East,
defeating Sir George E. Cartier, the French-Canadian colleague of Sir
John A. Macdonald. When the Liberal Leader, the Hon. Alexander Mackenzie
was Prime Minister, Mr. Jetté was offered the position of Minister of
Justice, but accepted in preference a place on the Bench. This he
retained for twenty years up to 1898, when he was appointed
Lieutenant-Governor of his native province. While still practising his
profession in Montreal, he became Professor of Civil Law in Laval
University and a Dean of its Faculty, having been honored by the same
with the degree of LL.D., as well as by Bishop’s College University with
a D.C.L. and by Toronto University with an LL.D. In 1891 he was
appointed Chairman of the Royal Commission charged with the
investigation of affairs connected with the Baie-des-Chaleurs Railway,
finally refusing to agree, however, to the decision of his two
colleagues. The several other offices he has filled are many and
important. After his term as Lieutenant-Governor had expired, he was
given a second term. And at the end of his second term he was appointed
Chief Justice of the Court of King’s Bench, retiring in 1911. Few
Canadians have had so many honors conferred upon them as has Sir Louis
Jetté. These include his university degrees; his knighthood from the
King of England; his Legion of Honour from France, of which he is a
Commander; the many addresses he has received from his fellow-members of
the Bar, as well as from the people; not to speak of his receptions by
King George and his late royal father, King Edward, and His Holiness the
Pope. He has been associated with the Société de Legislation Comparée;
with the Société d’Histoire Diplomatique of Paris (France); was a member
of the Alaska Boundary Tribunal; a Director of the Montreal Polytechnic
School; a member of the Council of Public Instruction, and an honorary
member of the Literary and Historical Society of Quebec. In his earlier
years he was a contributor to certain city journals, having been editor
of one of them known as “L’Ordre.” His “Observations Relating to the
Code of Civil Procedure” proves him to be possessed of a wide vision and
keen insight, both as a lawyer and a literary expositor. The encomiums
which have been passed upon his services as a public servant go to show
Chief Justice Sir Melbourne Tait was in no way astray in his high
estimate of Sir Louis Jetté’s mental culture and administrative
astuteness, not only as a public speaker, but as a writer and overseer
of what is in line with justice and dignity of rule. He was married in
1862, to Miss Bertha Laflamme, daughter of the late Touissant Laflamme,
and sister of the Hon. R. Laflamme, the distinguished barrister and
advocate of Montreal. Lady Jetté, who is an authoress in her own right,
having written a Life of Madame d’Youville, won a further good name for
herself and her distinguished husband for the hospitalities they were
always pleased to extend to their guests at Spencer Wood during the two
terms and more of Governor Jetté’s residence there as Governor.

=Kennedy, William Costello=, Member for North Essex in the House of
Commons of Canada, is a resident of Windsor, Ont., and a prominent
figure in the oil and gas industry of the Essex Peninsula. He was born
at Ottawa, Ont., August 27, 1868, the son of William and Julia
(Costello) Kennedy. While he was yet a boy his parents moved to Toronto
to reside and he was educated in the Separate Schools and De La Salle
Institute, of that city. He began his business career in 1887 as a clerk
in the offices of the London and Canadian Loan and Agency Company,
Toronto, at that time one of the best known financial corporations of
the province. With this company he remained until 1897 when he accepted
an offer to go to Windsor, Ont., and engage in the oil and natural gas
industry. In 1903 he became President of the Windsor Gas Company and
continued in that office until 1917. At the present time he has many
interests in the city of his adoption. He was President of the Board of
Trade for the years 1909 and 1910, and a member of the Windsor Board of
Education from 1913 to 1918; and also a councillor of the municipality
of Ojibway during the same period. From early manhood Mr. Kennedy had
been a Liberal in politics and in 1917 when Sir Robert Borden formed a
Union Government and decided to carry out the policy of conscription
without submitting the question to the Canadian people through the
medium of a referendum, he was one of those Liberals who stood back of
Sir Wilfrid Laurier in opposing such a course. Though at the time it was
supposed that he was facing almost certain defeat he accepted the
Liberal nomination for North Essex. He was opposed by Col. Wigle, who
was generally regarded as a very strong candidate. In the two months’
campaign that ensued Mr. Kennedy made many friends by his sane and
reasonable methods of electioneering and when the ballots were counted
on December 17, 1917, it was found that he had been elected by a
handsome majority, which was not annulled by the vote of the soldiers
overseas, details of which were received later. During the parliamentary
session Mr. Kennedy made his maiden speech as a legislator in the budget
debate, and made a very fine impression on friends and political
opponents alike by his brilliant handling of financial questions. Old
parliamentarians were agreed that it was one of the most promising
initial speeches ever made at Ottawa, and ever since the member for
North Essex has been regarded as an important factor in the future of
his party. His recreations are golf and motoring, and he is a member of
the following clubs: Detroit, Detroit Athletic, Essex County Golf,
Windsor and Ontario, Toronto. In religion he is a Roman Catholic and on
May 8, 1907, married Glencora, daughter of George W. Bolton, Detroit,
Michigan.

=Mitchell, Robert Menzies, Hon.= (Weyburn, Sask.), is a native of Port
Union, Ont., where he was born October 28, 1865, the son of James
Mitchell, a farmer, and Elizabeth Rodger, his wife. His father came of
Scottish ancestry, some of whose descendants settled in Canada and some
in Australia. Madame Melba, the great Australian prima donna, whose
maiden name was Nellie Mitchell, is a cousin of the subject of this
sketch. The latter was educated at Orangeville High School and Trinity
Medical School, Toronto, graduating M.D., C.M. in April, 1892. He at
once commenced the practice of medicine at Dundalk, Dufferin County,
Ont., and remained there until 1899, when he settled at Weyburn, Sask.,
and continued in active practice there until 1907. He was Chairman of
the Weyburn Public School Board for ten years, and of the High School
Board for five years. In August, 1908, he was elected to the
Saskatchewan Legislature as a Liberal for the constituency of Weyburn,
and has been re-elected at each ensuing election. He was Chairman of the
Private Bills and Railways Committee of the Legislature for six years,
and was chosen as Deputy Speaker in 1916. Shortly afterward he was made
Speaker, and on his return to the House after the general elections of
1917 was re-elected to that office. Though a Liberal his fairness and
impartiality in the conduct of debate has made him universally popular
among politicians of all shades of opinion. He is a member of the
following fraternal orders: A.F. & A.M., I.O.O.F., and C.O.F.; of the
Weyburn Club, and the Assiniboia Club, Regina. His recreations are
football and curling, and in religion he is a Presbyterian. On August
17, 1892, he married Margaret, daughter of Donald and Flora McKinnon,
Badjeros, Ont., and his two sons have both served their country with
honor in the great war. R. C. Mitchell, born July 11, 1893, went
overseas with the First Canadian Expeditionary Force in 1914, and D. J.
Mitchell, born February 15, 1895, became a member of the Royal Air Force
a year or so later.

=Lemieux, the Honorable Sir François-Xavier=, Chief Justice of the
Superior Court of Quebec, was born at Levis on the 9th of April, 1851,
the son of Antoine and Henriette (Lagueux) Lemieux. From the Levis
College he entered the Quebec Seminary and afterwards graduated from
Laval University, in 1872, taking the degree of LL.B. In the same year
he started on his career as a lawyer in the city of Quebec, taking rank
almost immediately as an efficient pleader in the criminal courts of the
Lower St. Lawrence districts. His eloquent fluency and finesse as a
defender brought him into a lucrative practice; and there were in time
few prominent cases of criminality brought into court in which his
services were not sought after. Nor did his legal acumen in winning
cases arouse any envious feeling against him among his legal brethren,
since in 1896 he was elected Batonnier of the Quebec Bar, and in the
following year Batonnier-General of the Provincial Bar. Turning his
attention to politics, he sat as member of Levis in the Legislative
Assembly for nine years, and afterwards as member for Bonaventure, for
three years. As an orator, he has a marvellous faculty on the hustings
of carrying any large audience with him in his argument. At length the
widest fame came to him when he was called upon to defend Louis Riel,
the rebel leader of the half-breeds and Indians in the North-West, in
1885. The charge of high treason against the culprit was sustained, but
his legal defender was nevertheless acclaimed as one of the shrewdest
lawyers that could have been engaged to defend him. Subsequently, in
1892, he was chosen to defend the Honorable Honore Mercier, Premier of
Quebec, before the criminal court, under charges of maladministration.
Mr. Mercier was honorably acquitted. Five years after the subject of
this biography was appointed Puisne Judge in the district of Arthabaska
and afterwards in Sherbrooke. From Sherbrooke, he was finally removed to
Quebec where he holds the office of Chief Justice for the Province of
Quebec. The literary talents of Sir François have been proven by his
lectures and essays. His acumen as a judge has been openly acknowledged
by his professional associates. He is a citizen well worthy the honor
conferred upon him by King George and by Laval University, in the one
case of Knighthood and in the other an LL.D. His father-in-law, the late
Justice Plamondon, was a judge of the Superior Court of Quebec, Miss
Diana Plamondon becoming his wife in 1874.

=Turgeon, The Hon. Adelard, LL.D., C.M.G., C.V.O., Knight of the Legion
of Honour of France= (Quebec City), President of the Legislative Council
of the Province of Quebec, and a Governor of Laval University, was born
at Beaumont in the Province of Quebec, on December 19, 1863. He is the
son of Mr. Damase Turgeon, and was educated at Levis College and at
Laval University. Called to the Bar in 1887, he opened a law office in
Levis, but afterwards entered into partnership in Quebec with the
prominent legal firm of Roy, Langlais & Godbout. His career as a
parliamentarian was inaugurated by his election as member for
Bellechasse in 1890, a constituency which he continued to represent up
to 1909, when he retired from the Legislative Assembly to take his seat
in the Legislative Council and assume the high office of Speaker or
President of that body. While a member of the Assembly his eloquence
became an attractive feature in the many important debates in which he
took part, alike as Member and Minister. As an administrator and
public-spirited citizen, he has taken high rank as a publicist, having
retained the favor of Bellechasse from term to term for over a decade.
During the Tercentennial Celebration at Quebec in 1908, he was honored
by the Prince of Wales, now King George V, and was shortly afterwards
chosen as one of the members of the National Battlefields Commission,
which has ever since been engaged in laying out and beautifying one of
the most spacious public parks in Canada. In 1897 he was called to join
the Marchand Government as Minister of Colonization, holding the same
office in the Parent Cabinet, until he was chosen to act as Minister of
Agriculture and Provincial Secretary. In 1905, the Parent Administration
was transformed into the Gouin Administration, and in the latter Mr.
Turgeon accepted the portfolio of Lands and Forests, holding the same up
to 1909. On resigning his seat in the Assembly as a challenge to some of
his detractors, he was re-elected against Henri Bourassa by the electors
of Bellechasse as an acknowledgement of his mature administrative
abilities, and a warrant to his resuming his place in the Gouin Cabinet,
as well as preparing the way for his being called to the high office of
President of the Legislative Council. During his public career, he has
held many important positions outside of his parliamentary functions,
among these being President of the Quebec Land Company, Vice-President
of the Provincial Securities Company, Director of the Quebec Transfer
and Cartage Company, and member of the Comptoir Mobilier-Franco-Canadien
Company. He was one of the founders of the Society of L’Union Liberale,
and prominently connected with various political clubs. In July, 1887,
he married Miss Eugenie Samson, the daughter of Mr. Etienne Samson, of
Levis. As President of the Upper Chamber of the Provincial Parliament,
Mr. Turgeon has his residence within the precincts of the Parliament
Buildings, wherein his hospitalities form a prominent feature in the
social life of the community when parliament is in session, as well as
at other times.

=White, Rt. Hon. Sir William Thomas, P.C., M.P.=, Finance Minister of
Canada, is a Canadian statesman whose meteoric rise to fame during less
than a decade, has attracted more than national attention. He was born
at Bronte, Ont., November 13, 1866, the son of James and Elizabeth
(Graham) White. His father was a farmer and his early education was
obtained at Oakville public school and Brampton High School. Later he
entered Toronto University and graduated in 1895 with the degree of B.A.
and honors in classics. During his university career he won two
first-class scholarships and a gold medal. Subsequently he took up a
course of law at Osgoode Hall, Toronto and was called to the Bar of the
province in 1899, but never practised. During his period as an arts and
law student he supported himself, first as a reporter on the Toronto
“Telegram,” where his writings showed singular eloquence and ability;
and later, as one of the assessors of the Civic Assessment Department.
The knowledge of real estate values and of financial questions which he
had gained in the latter capacity, as well as his general abilities, led
a group of Toronto capitalists to tender him in 1900, the General
Managership of the National Trust Company, which they had recently
formed. This post he held for nearly eleven years and during that
interval attained a high status in the financial community. Though a
Liberal in politics, he had never been known as an active politician. In
the summer of 1911, when Sir Wilfrid Laurier, then Prime Minister,
appealed to the country to ratify the Knox-Fielding pact calling for
reciprocity in natural products between Canada and the United States,
Mr. W. T. White, as he was then known, was one of eighteen prominent
Toronto Liberals who issued a manifesto against the proposals of their
former political chieftain and decided to support Mr. Robert Borden. He
himself took the platform against the pact as liable to disturb the
equilibrium of trade at a time when Canada was enjoying unexampled
prosperity. The result of this and other appeals was that many thousands
of voters, previously Liberal, abandoned the party lines and defeated
the Laurier administration by a large majority. When called upon to form
a government in the latter part of September, 1911, Mr. Borden felt that
it was due to the large number of Liberals who had supported him, that
they should be represented in the Cabinet. On consultation with the
leaders of the group, known as “Borden Liberals,” they were unanimously
of the opinion that Mr. White was the best available choice. Despite the
fact that he was without previous political experience, the Conservative
Leader decided to offer him the most important portfolio in the Cabinet,
that of the Ministry of Finance. On Mr. White’s accepting the office, a
seat was found for him in the House of Commons by the elevation of Mr.
George Taylor, M.P. for Leeds, and formerly Conservative whip, to the
Senate. At a by-election held on November 4, 1911, Mr. White was elected
to Parliament by a considerable majority, despite the fact that the
election was marked by severe personal attacks on him, because of his
so-called “desertion” of the Liberal party. Mr. White answered the
challenge by the statement that he “believed that there was no healthier
sign of the times than that an honest man should change his party in the
interests of his country.” His maiden speech in the House of Commons,
which was delivered on Nov. 29, 1911, was awaited throughout the country
with great interest, and at once stamped him as one of the coming men in
Canadian politics. Since then his budget speeches have proclaimed him as
a financier of masterly intellect. Had Mr. White known in 1911 that the
task lay before him of financing Canada’s contribution to the
prosecution of the greatest war the world has ever known, he would
possibly have declined office. When in 1914, Germany made war against
all Europe, and Canada decided to support the Motherland, perhaps the
gravest task of all fell on the Minister of Finance, because up to that
time Canada had been a heavy borrower from the Motherland, and these
sources of supply would naturally be cut off if the war continued for a
lengthy period. In fact, in 1914, many eminent financiers believed that
the financial resources of the world would not stand the strain of a war
of more than six months’ duration. The Canadian Minister of Finance
however laid his plans for a long war; and in addition to the task of
financing Canada’s magnificent military effort, applied himself to the
problem of keeping up Canada’s trade at a figure that would enable her
to continue as a belligerent. He had also the task thrust upon him of
acting as banker for Great Britain, France, Russia and other
belligerents, who made the finance department at Ottawa the clearing
house for their enormous financial dealings with the merchants and
manufacturers of the United States. During the first year of the war
Great Britain was able to render financial assistance to Canada and
others of the overseas dominions; and Mr. White floated some large loans
in the United States. But it was already apparent that Canada must
shortly finance herself. In 1916 he visited England and fully acquainted
himself with the situation, and in the same year was created a Knight
Commander of St. Michael and St. George, in recognition of his war
services. Sir Thomas decided to test Canada’s own resources and floated
a large war loan the bulk of it being taken by Canadian capitalists,
although a certain number of small investors were also attracted to it.
Up to 1917, however, there were only about 60,000 holders of Canadian
bonds in this country. In the summer of 1917, when Canada seemed to face
a serious financial crisis, Sir Thomas decided to try the experiment of
a great popular loan to be known as the Victory Loan, on the lines of
the popular loans floated during the American Civil War, by the
celebrated financier Jay Cooke. He collected a superb organization,
embracing all the leading financiers, newspapers and selling agencies of
Canada and asked the people to lend their government $300,000,000, to be
spent entirely in Canada for war purposes. The result passed all
expectations, for the loan was over-subscribed by more than one hundred
million dollars, and about 875,000 became holders of Victory Bonds.
Canada was enabled to do this by the fact that Sir Thomas and the Borden
administration as a whole had, by adopting the policy of financing
British credits in this country, secured enormous war orders for
agricultural supplies and munitions for her farmers and manufacturers,
so that the flow of money during the war reached unexampled heights. The
first Victory Loan of 1917 was fruitful of good results, because it
enabled Canada to continue this policy on a more extended scale, so
that, though this enormous sum was invested in bonds, and added to the
savings of the people, a few months later the average of deposits in the
savings banks of the country was larger than it had been before the
first Victory Loan was floated. In the latter part of 1917 the health of
Sir Thomas broke down as a result of his stupendous anxieties and
labors, but after a vacation of several months in California he returned
to this country restored in health. In the autumn of 1918 he decided to
float another Victory Loan, asking, as in 1917, for $300,000,000, but
setting the real objective at $500,000,000. The result was another
enormous over-subscription, nearly $700,000,000 having been subscribed.
That such a showing should have been made by a country so limited in
population as Canada, is the best proof of his skill as administrator of
the nation’s finances during the most trying epoch in the history of the
world. So thoroughly has Sir Thomas the confidence of his leader, Sir
Robert Borden, that when in November, 1918, he left Canada for an
indefinite absence as a member of the European Peace Conference, he
appointed the Minister of Finance Acting Prime Minister, to take charge
of the hazardous task of re-organizing the country on a peace basis. Sir
Thomas is a profound student and thinker and a public speaker of rare
ability. Among his activities prior to his removal to Ottawa were those
of a member of the Board of Governors of Toronto University and Trustee
of Toronto General Hospital. He is a Methodist in religion, and a member
of the Rideau Club, Ottawa, and the York and Toronto Clubs, Toronto. On
Sept. 20, 1890, he married Annie Isabel, daughter of Ellis Silverthorne,
Jarvis, Ont.

=Price, Sir William=, the prominent capitalist of Quebec City, who has
been engaged in military operations during the European War as Colonel
of the 171st Battalion, at Valcartier, and later as an officer at the
front, is a son of Mr. Henry Ferrier Price, who married Miss Florence
Rogerson. He was born at Talca, Chili, on August 30, 1867. His uncle was
the Hon. Senator E. J. Price, on whose death he became leading partner
of the firm of Price Brothers & Company, in 1886. He was educated at
Bishops College School, Lennoxville, P.Q., and later at St. Mark’s
School, Windsor, England. He has been prominent in the public life as
well as the business circles of Quebec, having been a member of
parliament for one of the electoral divisions of the place and
afterwards Chairman of the Harbor Commission. It was while he held the
latter office that he took service as one of the organizers of the
Valcartier Military Camp, earning high praise from the Governor-General
and the Militia Department, and finally receiving his knighthood at the
hands of King George. As Colonel in Command he raised the 171st
Battalion, which he took over to England in 1916, continuing his
services with the army as one of the officers of a Railway Construction
Battalion in France, after the 171st had been absorbed in other
battalions, in terms of what is known as the Territorial System. No
citizen of Quebec has earned higher credit for patriotic effort than Sir
William. Setting aside his many business duties and resigning a
lucrative government position, he ably fulfilled the duties assigned to
him as a soldier. The responsible positions he has held as a business
man and a public-spirited citizen have been manifold. Besides being
President of the Price Brothers & Company, he has been Director and
Honorary Chairman of the Union Bank; a Director of the Quebec Railway,
Light, Heat and Power Company; Vice-President of the Canadian
Lumberman’s Association; as well as being President of the Metis Lumber
Company, the Jonquiere Pulp and Paper Company, the Gravel Lumber
Company, and President of the Canadian Export Co. Nor did his business
engagements hinder him from taking an active part in civic and
charitable enterprises to which he has given beneficently of his means.
At one time he was a Governor of the Jeffrey Hale Hospital, President of
the Board of Trade, Director of the Trans-Canadian Railway project, an
energetic supporter of the movement in favor of the National
Battlefields Park, and President of the Quebec Turf Club. As far back as
1887, he took a practical interest in local military affairs, having
been a lieutenant in the Eighth Royal Rifles, and being raised to his
captaincy before his withdrawal from that company in 1903. As a prelude
to his activity as a military organizer at the Valcartier Camp, he
raised two companies for service during the Boer War, and encouraged
rifle practice by presenting the Price Cup for competition at the
targets. As a parliamentarian he had a term of three years; but his
earlier defeat in the Rimouski constituency was repeated by Quebec West
in 1911. As has been well said of him, he has proved himself to be a
citizen of whom any community might well be proud. He was married in
1894, to Miss Amelia Blanche Smith, daughter of Mr. R. H. Smith, another
of Quebec’s most prominent and worthy lumber merchants. His family
consists of four sons and two daughters. Sir William has since his early
days been an enthusiast as a “portageur,” and a keen sportsman. He owns
two salmon-breeding rivers and extensive hunting grounds. While
soldiering abroad, he continued head of his firm, which has in its
employment several thousands of employees.

=Kemp, Hon. Sir Albert Edward= (Toronto, Ont.), son of Robert Kemp, an
Englishman, and Sarah A. Kemp, his wife, a Canadian; born at
Clarenceville, Que., August 11, 1858, and educated at Clarenceville and
Lacolle Academy. For many years the subject of this sketch has been one
of the leading manufacturers of Canada, and a successful business man.
Since 1895 he has devoted considerable time to questions of public
interest. In 1879 he married a Miss Wilson, of Montreal. He was
President of the Canadian Manufacturers Association in 1895 and was
re-elected in 1896. He was elected President of the Toronto Board of
Trade for the year 1899, and re-elected in 1900. In 1898 he was
appointed a delegate by the Board to the British Association, at its
annual meeting held in Bristol, also to the Fourth Congress of the
Chambers of Commerce of the Empire, held in London, June, 1900. He is a
member of the Board of Regents of Victoria University, Toronto; a member
of several Orders, among which is included the Orange Order, and many
National and Philanthropic Societies. Mr. Kemp was first elected to the
House of Commons at the general elections in 1900, and again returned in
1904. In 1908 he was defeated, but was re-elected at the general
elections in 1911 by a very large majority. Upon the resignation of Sir
Wilfrid Laurier and his Cabinet on October 6, 1911, following the defeat
of the Liberal Party at the polls the previous September, he joined the
Borden Government as Minister without Portfolio, and was sworn in a
member of the Privy Council for Canada on October 10, 1911. After the
outbreak of the war he was called upon by his Government to assume many
important positions, among which was included the Chairmanship of the
War Supplies Purchasing Commission, a position that required the keenest
foresight, courage and action, and which practically demanded all his
time. It later developed that the Government made no mistake in placing
him at the head of this Commission, and great credit is due him for the
manner in which he conducted its affairs. Upon the resignation of Sir
Sam Hughes, Minister of Militia in the Borden Government, in November,
1916, Mr. Kemp was asked by Sir Robert Borden to accept the position as
Minister of Militia, and accepted, and on December 14, 1916, was
re-elected by acclamation by his constituents in East Toronto.
Subsequently he was asked to accept the post of Overseas Minister,
resident in London, and in this capacity he served throughout the
momentous period of 1918, when he was directly in touch with Canada’s
Army in France. In social life he has many friends, and is always ready
to receive them in a manner that draws them closer to him. As a public
man there is a great future before him, and he has won praise for having
accepted office at the most critical moment in the history of Canada.
When the greatest war the world has known draws to a close, and the
history of the noble sons who fought and worked with the Allies in their
different nations is written, the name of Hon. Albert Edward Kemp will
come in for a full share of credit for the able and systematic methods
adopted in helping the Motherland to continue to wave the flag that
stands for freedom and justice. In religion he is a Methodist.

=Cameron, Lieut.-Colonel Sir Douglas, K.C.M.G.=, ex-Lieutenant-Governor
of Manitoba (Winnipeg, Man.), was born in Prescott County, Ont., June
18, 1854, the son of Colin and Annie Cameron, and was educated at the
High School, Vankleek Hill, Ont. He was engaged in farming in the
Province of Ontario from 1871 to 1880, afterwards moving to Winnipeg, in
1880. He engaged in various occupations until the fall of 1883, when he
entered the lumber business under the firm name of Cameron & Company;
later, Cameron & Kennedy. The business was incorporated as the Ontario &
Western Lumber Company in 1892, and was later changed to the Rat Portage
Lumber Company, and he has acted as General Manager since 1892, and
President since 1894. He is also President of the Maple Leaf Flour
Mills, a Director of the Northern Crown Bank, and a Director of the
Manitoba Bridge and Iron Company. In 1902 he was elected to the Ontario
Legislature for Fort William and Lake-of-the-Woods, and was defeated in
the general elections of 1905 and 1908; was also an unsuccessful
candidate for the House of Commons for Winnipeg in the Federal general
elections in 1908. On August 1, 1911, he was appointed
Lieutenant-Governor of the Province of Manitoba, which office he filled
with the greatest satisfaction until succeeded by the present incumbent,
Sir James Albert Manning Aikins, K.B. He was a Councillor for Rat
Portage in 1891, and Mayor from 1891 to 1894; was appointed a K.C.M.G.,
December 31, 1913. In 1910 he was appointed Honorary Lieutenant-Colonel
of the 79th Highlanders, and has been very active in connection with the
Militia since the outbreak of the war, as well as in Patriotic work. He
married Margaret Cameron Ferguson, of Vankleek Hill, in 1880, to whom
were born two sons and one daughter; is a member of the Manitoba Club
and the St. Charles Country Club, and as a recreation is an admirer of
horses. Sir Douglas is a staunch Liberal in politics, and is considered,
by the leaders of his party, as one of the ablest statesmen in Canada.
In religion he is a Presbyterian and an active worker in Church and
Social Reform movements.

=Bégin, Louis Nazaire, Cardinal Archbishop of Quebec=, was born on
January 10, 1840. He is the son of Charles Bégin, of Levis, his mother’s
maiden name having been Miss Luce Paradis. His earlier education was had
in the schools and colleges of the Quebec district, up to the time of
his leaving for Europe, to prepare himself as a priest and professor.
Ordained in Rome in 1865, he returned to Quebec to assume the duties of
Professor of Theology and Church History in Laval University, with
collateral duties for a time as Prefect of Studies in what is known as
Le Petit Séminaire. It was in 1885 he was appointed Principal of Laval
Normal School at the time that institution occupied the premises of the
old Chateau Haldimand, over the site of which the spacious Chateau
Frontenac now extends its massive wings. Three years after, he was named
Bishop of Chicoutimi, eventually returning to Quebec to take up his
residence in the Archbishop’s Palace as Coadjutor of Cardinal
Taschereau, under the title of Archbishop of Cyrene. From 1894 to 1898,
he continued to be the Administrator of the Archdiocese of Quebec,
during the declining years of Cardinal Taschereau. On the death of the
latter, he succeeded him in the See of Quebec, the ceremony of his
official investiture in 1899 being an historic event of the greatest
interest to the whole province, as was the later celebration of his
election as a Cardinal under the title of Saint Vitalis. The details of
the distinguished ecclesiastic’s career form a brilliant page in the
annals of Canada. Alike at home and abroad, His Eminence Cardinal Bégin
has ever been known to fulfil his duty towards his Church and as a loyal
citizen of Canada. Frequently he has been called to foreign parts to
share in celebrations, such as the solemn coronation ceremonies of Our
Lady of Guadalupe at Mexico City, in 1895, where he preached one of the
memorial sermons, as well as at Rheims, during a like celebration in
1896, and at Grosse Isle in 1909, when he was the principal speaker at
the unveiling of the monument erected to the memory of the Irish
immigrants who had fallen victims to the typhus epidemic in 1847. He has
also been several times a guest at the Vatican, having enjoyed the
confidence of the three successive popes, Leo XIII, Pius X, and Benedict
XV, from the last of whom he received his red hat. He has ever been a
participant in all the public movements that tended to improve the
social and educational conditions in his diocese, having taken a leading
part in the founding of one of the leading newspapers of Quebec, known
as “L’Action Catholique” and having likewise obtained the restoration of
the Cathedral Chapter of Quebec, an institution that had become extinct
from the days of the Conquest. He was prominent in the enterprise of
unveiling a monument to the memory of Bishop Laval, as he has also been
in the various efforts put forth towards beautifying the city with parks
and monumental structures commemorative of historic events. He is a
Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, and has been honored by
scholastic degrees of the highest merit, bestowed on him by the
University of Innsbruck, in Austria, as well as those he has received
from Laval and the Gregorian University of Rome. He virtually began his
professional career as a teacher of the young, and has never lost his
zeal in promoting, as a Member of the Council of Public Instruction, the
reforms that make for a right pedagogy in school and college work. His
pen has been an active one in adding to the literature to be found in
the library collections of his Church, such as “La Règle de Foi” and the
“Culte Catholique” not to speak of his writings on Canadian historical
topics, as for instance, his “Chronologie d’Histoire du Canada,” his
pastoral letters on the “Three Hundredth Anniversary of the Foundation
of Quebec,” and his address on the “Second Centenary of the Death of
Bishop Laval.” So wide is his knowledge of human affairs, so urbane is
he in his manner and so just in his decisions, so charitable is he in
his approach to the two sides of a public question, that he has more
than once been called upon to act as arbitrator between employer and
employees. During the many years of his episcopate he has organized over
fifty new parishes, and has never failed to urge the building of
spacious churches and school-houses and convents in the most of them.
The events of his life have been for the most part the events of his
native province and of Canada as well. Even during his travels abroad he
always seems to have had in his mind the maturing of a policy of
betterment for his people, and the fostering of good will among the
various elements of the populations of Canada.

=Lynch, Hon. William Warren, B.C., Q.C., D.C.L., LL.D.=, was born near
the Village of Bedford, County of Missisquoi, Province of Quebec, on
September 30, 1845. His father, Thomas Lynch, came from the County of
Cavan, Ireland, about the year 1830. He served during the Canadian
Rebellion in the Shefford Troop of Cavalry, and died at Knowlton, Brome
County, on March 19, 1883. His mother, Charlotte R. Williams, was born
at Stukely, County of Shefford, Province of Quebec, in the year 1805.
Her parents were descendants of U.E. Loyalists, who came from the State
of Vermont at the close of the American Revolutionary War. She died in
1885. Mr. Lynch, after taking advantage of the elementary schools in the
vicinity of his birthplace, went to Stanbridge Academy in 1858, then a
most flourishing institution, under the direction of Hobart Butler,
M.A., where he prepared himself for a university course. During his last
years at Stanbridge he acted as assistant teacher to Mr. Butler, and
then entered the University of Vermont, Burlington, in August, 1861, but
owing to the Civil War, which had shortly before broken out, the
university course was considerably affected, and Mr. Lynch did not
continue his studies there. In September, 1862, he entered the Arts
Course of McGill University, Montreal, having secured one of the
scholarships offered at a competitive examination. His health failing,
he was obliged to abandon his studies before the Christmas examinations.
He then engaged in school teaching in winter, and worked on his father’s
farm in summer. In 1865 he was admitted to the study of the law, and
pursued his studies in the office, first of S. W. Foster, of Knowlton,
and afterwards of John Monk, of Montreal. He took his degree of B.C.L.
at McGill in May, 1868, and secured the Elizabeth Torrance gold medal,
and was admitted to practice in June. The following year he commenced
the practice of his profession at Knowlton, and subsequently removed to
Sweetsburg, the chef lieu of Bedford District. In the fall of 1870 he
assumed the editorial control of the “Observer,” which was started at
Cowansville, an adjoining village, and which became an influential organ
of public opinion in the district. In June, 1871, during the provincial
elections, which were then in progress, he went to Knowlton to report
for his paper the proceedings of nomination day. There were then two
candidates in the field, and to the surprise of Mr. Lynch, and without
his interference, both candidates withdrew, and he was declared member
elect for the County of Brome. During the Fenian troubles of 1866 Mr.
Lynch took an active part in the formation of a company of volunteers at
Brome, of which he became lieutenant, and remained such until his
resignation in 1871. During the Fenian raid of 1870 he was at the front
with his battalion. In keeping with the promise made to his electors, he
became a resident of the County of Brome, returning to Knowlton in the
fall of 1871. He has held successively the offices of school
commissioner and chairman of that body for a number of years; and was
also the Mayor of the Township of Brome, and Warden of the County. In
May, 1874, he married Ellen Florence, eldest daughter of J. C. Pettes, a
successful merchant of Knowlton, by whom he has two children. He is a
member of the Masonic fraternity, and was some years since, deputy grand
master for the District of Bedford. Mr. Lynch early in life identified
himself with the Conservative party, to which he has ever borne faithful
allegiance. He took an active part in the political discussions in the
Legislature of Quebec on the subject of the dismissal of the De
Boucherville Government, by M. Letellier, and it was upon a motion made
by him that the Joly Government were defeated on October 30, 1879. He
was made a Q.C. by the Joly Government in 1879, which was subsequently
ratified by a similar title conferred upon him by the Federal
authorities in 1881. When M. Chapleau assumed office as premier of the
province, he invited Mr. Lynch to the council as Solicitor-General,
which appointment was subsequently ratified by the electorate of Brome.
On the abolition of the office of Solicitor-General, Mr. Lynch was
appointed Commissioner of Crown Lands, on July 31, 1882. In September,
1887, his constituents tendered him a reception in the shape of a
picnic, which was attended by a large number of public men, and at which
a presentation of a handsome sum of money was made to him by his
political admirers and friends. He then went to Montreal to resume the
practice of his profession, in partnership with the present Mr. Justice
Archibald and Mr. Geo. G. Foster, K.C. Shortly after, he was appointed
by the Dominion Government a Commissioner, in conjunction with the late
Mr. Justice Burridge, then Deputy Minister of Justice, and Mr. Dingman,
of the Department of the Interior, to settle the Indian title to certain
lands in the Township of Dundee, County of Huntington, and continued to
hold that office during the successive administrations of Messrs.
Mousseau, Ross and Taillon, and until the defeat of the last-named
administration in January, 1887. During the session of 1887 he was named
by the House of Assembly one of the Commissioners to perfect the
revision of the provincial statutes. He was one of the leaders of the
Opposition to the Government of the late Honore Mercier until his
appointment to the bench in July, 1889, as Judge of the Superior Court
for the District of Bedford, his native district. He has always taken a
warm interest in educational matters, was twice President of the
Provincial Association of Protestant Teachers, was for some years a
member of the Protestant Committee of the Council of Public Instruction,
and was the first President of the District of Bedford McGill Graduates’
Society. In June, 1883, the University of Bishops’ College offered him
the degree of D.C.L., but owing to absence it was not conferred. In
1904, McGill University gave him the degree of LL.D. He is a devoted
member of the Church of England and has often been a delegate to its
synods. Since he became judge he has devoted his leisure to the
promotion of various matters of local concern, such as good roads,
historical societies and the Knowlton Conference.

=Parmelee, William George, LL.D., D.C.L.= (Quebec City), English
Secretary of the Department of Public Instruction, and Joint Secretary
of the Council of Public Instruction of the Province of Quebec, was born
at Waterloo, in the Eastern Townships, in 1860. He is a son of Rufus E.
Parmelee, whose father had come originally from the United States. On
the mother’s side, the subject of this sketch is of Scottish descent. He
received his early education at Waterloo Academy, finally graduating as
a teacher from the McGill Normal School of Montreal. He afterward became
head master of the Model School Department and, later, a Professor of
the Normal School. Previous to his holding these positions, he had been
a member of the staff of St. Francis College, Richmond, P.Q., from 1881
to 1885. From McGill Normal School he was selected for his present
position in 1891; and for more than a quarter of a century he has been
in touch with the educational affairs of Quebec. He has proved himself a
departmental administrator of widely recognized professional acumen. The
academic honors that have been bestowed upon him from the time of his
extra-mural course at Queen’s University, from which he graduated in
1889, stand as an endorsation of his scholarship, these including a
D.C.L. from Bishop’s College in 1902, and an LL.D. from McGill
University in 1911. He has likewise been honored by being chosen more
than once, President of the Teachers’ Association of his native
province; President of the Literary and Historical Society of Quebec for
three several terms; President of the Young Men’s Association; a
delegate to the Federal Council of the United Empire Educational League
in London, England, and later on as a delegate to the Imperial
Conference on Education in the same centre. Taking an interest in local
military affairs he was awarded a Captaincy in the 8th Royal Rifles
Company, and later on received the honorary rank of Colonel. Nor has he
neglected literary pursuits in his spare moments, having had published
two of his papers read before the Literary and Historical Society, and
entitled, “Wolfe as a Man and a Soldier,” and “The Fraser Highlanders.”
He has also won high literary credit as joint-collaborateur with Dr.
Arthur Doughty, the Dominion Archivist, in six volumes dealing with the
“Siege of Quebec.” In 1886 he married Miss Louise Foss, of Waterloo.
Their family consists of four daughters.

=McCorkill, The Hon. Justice John Charles= (Quebec City), was born in
the town of Farnham, P.Q., on August 31, 1854. His father was Mr. Robert
McCorkill, of Farnham and the Eastern Townships. His mother’s maiden
name was Miss Margaret Meighen. His wife is a daughter of the Hon.
Senator Leonard of London, Ontario, their marriage having taken place in
1884. From the district elementary school, he entered the classes of the
McGill Model School, and in time obtained a certificate to teach from
the McGill Normal School. For a period he acted as Principal of the
Montreal British and Canadian School, thereafter taking his degree of
B.C.L. as a preliminary step to his becoming a lawyer. At first he
became a partner in the Greenshields legal firm, but subsequently
removed to the Bedford District and finally opened a central office at
Cowansville. While rising to a high rank as an advocate, he was
encouraged to enter the political field, and after suffering defeat
twice in succession, was at length elected to the Legislative Assembly
as the representative of Missisquoi. In time he was appointed
Legislative Councillor for the District of Bedford, where he was so
appreciatively known as a public-spirited citizen and an able lawyer,
who had held the position of Batonnier of the Bar and other offices of
rank. In 1903, he resigned his seat in the upper chamber of the
Provincial Parliament, to become Provincial Treasurer in the Parent
Administration, and was elected to the Legislature by the Constituency
of Brome. This office he held for three years, up to the time of his
appointment as a Judge of the Supreme Court for the District of Quebec.
While Treasurer, his term was marked by important legislation, such as
the revision of the taxation laws relating to banking institutions and
succession duties, which resulted in a surplus for the province of
half-a-million dollars. After the date of his appointment to the Bench,
he was made a Joint Commissioner with the Hon. Mr. Mathieu and Mr. L. J.
Gauthier, to revise the Municipal Code of the Province of Quebec. His
record as a legal practitioner and advocate, as well as a financier and
public-spirited citizen, has been a full one, wherever he has resided,
in Montreal, in the Eastern Townships, or in the city of Quebec. For
several years he was Mayor of Cowansville, where he was also President
of the Missisquoi Historical Society. He has been President of the
Literary and Historical Society of Quebec, and is a member of the
Council of Public Instruction. Even in military affairs he has taken an
active part, having been Captain as well as Major in the Militia between
the years of 1879 and 1887. His literary tastes have expressed
themselves in the historical papers he has written from time to time.
Altogether the Hon. Justice McCorkill may truly be spoken of as
possessing a forceful and clear-visioned personality, able and willing
always to share in the civic and provincial advancement of the community
in which he lives or has lived.

=Taschereau, The Hon. Louis Alexander= (Quebec City), Minister of Public
Works for the Province of Quebec, is the son of the Hon. Justice
Taschereau, who married Miss Josephine Caron, the daughter of the Hon.
Justice Caron, formerly Lieut.-Governor. He was born on the 5th of
March, 1867. He was educated at the Quebec Seminary and Laval
University, graduating as a Licentiate of Law in 1889, preliminary to
his entering upon his professional career as partner of Sir Charles
Fitzpatrick, now Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada. Later he
became associated with what is now the legal firm of Taschereau, Roy,
Cannon, Parent & Casgrain. As a lawyer, Mr. Taschereau came at once to
be recognized as one of the leading legal practitioners of the district,
among his successes being the part he took in the Gaynor and Greene
extradition case in 1902. In addition to his duties as an advocate he
took part in civic affairs, and for a time held a seat as an alderman of
his native city. In 1900, he was elected for the constituency of
Montmorency in the Legislative Assembly, and has continued ever since to
be its representative. Seven years after, with his skill in debate, duly
recognized by his parliamentary associates, he was selected to take his
place in the Gouin Administration as Minister of Public Works and Labor.
His administrative ability has been in keeping with his statesmanlike
insight and foresight, and his skill in debate. His advice is ever in
demand when any legal technicality has to be examined and explained to
both sides of the Assembly. In fact, he has taken a high place as the
Premier’s ally in all matters pertaining to the progress of the
province, while he has won the highest credit within parliamentary
circles and beyond them, for the efficiency of the Department in his
charge. He has been a member of the Battlefields Park Commission since
the day it was organized, and is likewise a Governor of the Catholic
Church Society. He is a nephew of the late Cardinal Taschereau,
Archbishop of Quebec. In 1891 he married Miss Adine Dionne, daughter of
the Hon. E. Dionne, of the Legislative Council of Quebec, by whom he has
had three sons and two daughters. Altogether he has made a record for
himself in his native city and province as an able advocate, an astute
governmental administrator, and a loyal citizen. Sprung from a
distinguished and talented family, his career as a public man has added
to its fame.

=Ross, James Gibb= (Quebec City), Senator of Canada, was born in
Carluke, a village of Lanarkshire, in Scotland, on April 18, 1819. He
came out to Canada in 1832, in company with his elder brother, John
Ross; and, after attending one of the private schools of Quebec for a
year or two, he entered the business office of his uncle, Mr. James
Gibb. At this time the firm of James Gibb & Company was one of the
largest of the wholesale grocery and provision houses in what has always
been known as the Lower Town of Quebec; and there the Scottish lad laid
the foundation of his business career, which was eventually to place him
among the wealthiest merchants of Canada. In 1843, Mr. Thomas O. Gibb,
son of Mr. James Gibb, returned to Quebec, after finishing his school
education in Edinburgh; and in the same year a company was formed in
which Thomas O. Gibb, John Ross, and James G. Ross were the partners,
until the first mentioned of the three died in 1845. Eventually, on Mr.
James Gibb’s death, the two Ross brothers took the business name of Ross
& Co., and as such continued in active operation up to the year 1868. By
this time the firm had amplified its business by other branches of
trading; and in 1868 the older of the two members of the firm withdrew
to conduct a business of his own, for the most part confined, as it was,
to the grocery and provision trade. With him was associated his youngest
brother, Frank Ross. At the time of the Senator’s death, in 1888, the
firm of Ross & Co. had developed into one of the wealthiest business
concerns in the country, having depots for the distribution of their
wares in nearly all the larger cities of Canada and the United States.
With millions at his command, the sole partner of the firm took an
active interest in shipbuilding and railroad construction. Nearly every
branch of industry was enhanced by the money advances of the
multi-millionaire. The shipping interests, especially, felt the effects
of his business acumen, especially when he took in charge for sailing
purposes the ships the building of which he had assisted with advances
of money, but which, for market reasons could not for a time be sold.
The railroads which came in for assistance included the Quebec and Lake
St. John Railway and the Quebec Central, both of which may trace their
success as paying concerns to the financial foresight of Senator James
G. Ross, who thus both directly and indirectly aided the colonization of
the country and its trading interests by the assistance he extended to
their promoters. Nor was it easy for one so prominent in the commercial
interests of the ancient capital to refuse to be nominated as a
candidate for parliamentary honors. On two several occasions he was
called upon to contest the electoral division of Quebec Centre, once in
the Conservative interest in 1872, against Mr. Cauchon, afterwards
Governor of Manitoba, and a second time as an Independent, in 1878,
against Mr. Malouin. In both instances he was defeated, though
afterwards he was considered worthy to succeed the Hon. David Price as
Senator, in 1884. He was unmarried; but in the families of his two
brothers, John and Frank, he is notably represented to-day by Mr. John
Theodore Ross, the only son of the former, and Frank W. Ross, surviving
son of the latter, both of whom have evidently in them the desire
inherited from their uncle, James G. Ross, to advance the interests of
their native city. The Hon. Senator Ross was a prominent citizen other
than in business and political circles. He took an interest in school
improvements and church advancement. He was for many years President of
the Quebec Bank, a Director of the Quebec High School, and an elder in
Chalmers Church. As may well be said of his beneficent uncle, James
Gibb, Senator James Gibb Ross was a liberal benefactor to the
institutions of Quebec, both before his death and after it. He
accumulated his millions in Peter Street, and every Protestant
institution in the city of his adoption benefited by his wealth in some
way or another.

=Gouin, The Hon. Sir Jean Lomer, K.C.M.G., LL.B., LL.D.=, Premier of the
Province of Quebec, was born at Brondines, of the County of Portneuf, on
March 19, 1861. He comes from a French-Canadian stock whose lineage can
be traced as far back as 1662. His father was J. N. Gouin, M.D., who
married Miss Victoire Seraphine Fugère in 1852. In his earlier years,
their son Lomer became a pupil of Sorel College, thereafter entering as
an under-graduate the College of Levis, and afterwards graduating at
Laval University. His collegiate honors include the degree of LL.D.,
received successively from Laval in 1902, from Bishop’s College
University in 1913, and from Toronto University in 1915. He was called
to the Bar in 1884, after studying law under the late Sir John Abbott
and the Hon. B. Laflamme. He had thus been a student under the
supervision of a Prime Minister of Canada and of a Minister of Justice.
During his partnership with Judge Pagnuello and the Hon. Premier Honore
Mercier, whose daughter Eliza he married in 1888, he came into
prominence in the law courts of Montreal, being finally elected
Batonnier-General in 1910, after having served a term as Alderman of
that city, and elected a Member of the Local Legislature. In 1900 he
became Commissioner of Public Works in the Parent Administration for
four years. Resigning his place in the Parent Cabinet in 1904, he was
called to the premiership the year after, holding the portfolio of
Attorney-General up to the present time. During the general election of
1916 his administration of public affairs was upheld by a majority never
before vouchsafed to a Quebec premier; while the list of honors
conferred upon him since his advent to power is perhaps one of the
longest on record. He was knighted by the reigning Sovereign of the
Empire at the Quebec Tercentenary Celebration of 1908, and was made a
K.C.M.G. in the year 1913. Ever animated with a desire to see his native
province an advancing factor in the general progress of the Dominion of
Canada, as well as of the British Empire, he has been diligent in
promoting the public works that have to be fostered within the counties
and parishes, as well as in the cities and larger towns, in line with
the general advancement of the commonwealth. He has done his best to
improve the educational conditions of the communities, not forgetting
likewise to improve the highways and the industrial activities all over
the province. His zeal in establishing and liberally subsidizing
Industrial Schools and Technical Colleges has become a proverb in all
the provinces; while, in view of his support of a provincial grant of
one million dollars to the Canadian Patriotic Fund during the time of
war, his reputation as a broad-minded Canadian citizen has been placed
beyond all questioning. Senator David has pronounced a eulogium on
Premier Gouin that places him in rank with, if not beyond, those who
have preceded him in the Quebec premiership. Within these war-times he
has advocated a National War Service in the most fervent terms,
illustrating Senator David’s estimate of his statesmanship as that of a
highly capable servant of the State, in his impartial judgment,
prudence, eloquence, and administrative acumen. His share in the Bonne
Entente mission to Ontario in 1917, to plead, with others, for a closer
mutual understanding between the two leading races in Canada, has given
an éclat to his statesmanship. He would see Canada a unit while aiding
the mother lands in Europe by force of arms, and thus uphold the
prestige of the British Empire. And the various offices Sir Lomer Gouin
has held from the day he entered public life in 1891, indicate the
strenuous part he has played as a public-spirited Canadian. In 1891, he
was President of the National Club in Montreal, which was virtually “the
Executive of the Liberal Party” in the Montreal district. That year he
was defeated in his first election contest. Six years after he was
elected representative for the St. James Electoral Division of Montreal,
and thereafter has been member for his native County of Portneuf. He has
continued to be a Member of the Council of Public Instruction since
1898; became President of the American Fish and Game Protection
Association in 1910; was Chairman of the Ottawa Inter-provincial
Conference in 1906, and afterwards a delegate to a like Conference in
1910. As from one “learned in the law,” his edition of the Municipal
Code is a standard work; while no one has so well at his command the
details of parliamentary law-and-order as he has, as leader of the House
of Assembly. The record of his regime is concisely given in a neat
little volume published in 1916, under the title of “Le Gouvernment
Gouin et Son Oeuvre.” Another volume referring to the federal subsidies
in favor of the provinces was published in 1903, giving the amplified
record of an address delivered by Sir Lomer under the heading of “The
Actual Question.” These volumes, together with the reports of his
speeches from time to time, indicate how Sir Lomer Gouin has ever had in
mind the public interest—seeing to the improving of the conditions in
his native province, even to the widening out of its area as in the case
of the annexation of the District of Ungava, building government works,
and highways, and bridges, and never forgetting to urge it to keep pace
with its sister provinces in the federacy which includes them all within
the Dominion of Canada. In seeing to the advancement of the province he
has in charge as premier, he has made fame for himself as a loyal
statesman and dignified scholar, duly honored by the King and his
country’s seats of learning. He was married to Miss Alice Amos, his
second wife, in 1911. By his first wife he has had two sons—Leon, who
is practising law in Montreal; and Paul, who is a lieutenant on active
service.

=Drayton, Sir Henry Lumley, K.C., K.B.=, Chief Commissioner, Board of
Railway Commissioners for Canada, was born in Kingston, Ontario, April
27, 1869. He is the son of Philip Henry Drayton, who came to Canada with
the 16th Rifles of England, and Margaret S. (Covernton) Drayton. He was
educated in the schools of England and Canada. On September 14, 1892, he
married Edith Mary Cawthra, daughter of the late Joseph Cawthra,
Toronto, and has three daughters. Sir Henry Drayton was called to the
Ontario Bar in 1891 and soon became recognized as one of the leaders in
the legal profession. In September 1893, he was appointed Assistant City
Solicitor for Toronto, and when he resigned in September, 1900, he was
presented with a gold watch in recognition of the valuable services he
had rendered to the city in his legal capacity. He immediately
(September, 1900), formed partnership with Charles J. Holman, K.C., and
in January, 1902, was appointed Counsel to the Railway Committee of the
Ontario Legislature by the Chairman, the Hon. John Dryden. The following
year he was appointed representative of the Ontario Government for the
purpose of adjudicating upon and paying, on behalf of the Government,
the claims of workmen of the different Clergue Companies operating at
Sault Ste. Marie, and on January 29, 1904, he was appointed County Crown
Attorney for the County of York, on the recommendation of the Hon. J. M.
Gibson. In 1905 he was appointed Counsel on Civic Bribery Investigation,
Toronto, the Civic Investigation Court House in 1906, the Public School
Board Investigation, and also the Civic Investigation into the Medical
Health Department. January the 20th, 1908, he was created K.C. He
resigned his position as County Crown Attorney in 1909, and the
following year, April 25, 1910, was appointed Counsel for the
Corporation of the City of Toronto. May 11, 1911, he was appointed as
representative of the Ontario Government a member of the Toronto Power
Commission. When on July 1, 1912, he was appointed Chief Commissioner of
the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada the Toronto City Council
presented him with an illuminated album. In July, 1913, he was appointed
Commissioner to deal with the question of Control of Ocean Freight
Rates. In 1917 Sir Henry Drayton was appointed a member of the
Drayton-Smith-Acworth Commission which investigated the Canadian railway
situation. When the work of the Commission was completed and their
report presented to the Government, he, as his fee for his able services
on the Commission, was presented with a cheque for $15,000 by the
Dominion Government. He refused to accept payment and returned the
cheque. Acknowledging the receipt of the returned cheque the then
Minister of Railways and Canals, Hon. Mr. Cochrane, wrote in part as
follows: “I can assure you that your very patriotic attitude in this
matter is most sincerely appreciated by the Government at a time when
every dollar which can be saved is of material importance to the
successful prosecution of the war.” In very many other ways since the
war commenced in 1914, Sir Henry Drayton has rendered valuable
services—financially, as a member of committees and in the direction of
transportation, supply and other matters. He is ever to the fore to do
all he can to help Canada successfully bear the burdens—financially,
commercially and otherwise—that this war has forced her to carry and no
one has ever rendered such services more freely and willingly. Sir Henry
Drayton is a member of the Toronto, Toronto Hunt, Ontario Jockey,
Rideau, Ottawa Royal Golf, Country (Ottawa), Connaught Park Jockey
(Ottawa), and the Kaministiquia (Fort William) Clubs. His address is 233
Metcalfe St., Ottawa.

=Dobell, Sir Charles Macpherson, K.C.B., C.M.G., D.S.O.= (Quebec City),
Lieutenant-General of the British Army, is a son of the late Hon. R. R.
Dobell, lumber merchant, of Quebec, and a grandson of Senator Sir David
Macpherson, at one time Speaker of the Canadian Senate. He is a native
of Quebec, having been born on June 22, 1869. Receiving his elementary
education at the Rev. Canon Von Iffland’s Private School, he became a
student at the Quebec High School and later at the Charterhouse School
in England, previous to his entering the Royal Military College at
Kingston, Ontario. From that institution he graduated in 1890. After
serving as a Lieutenant in the Hazara Expedition, wherein his bravery
was mentioned in dispatches and by the award of a medal and clasp, his
advancement has proceeded steadily with his experience in active
service. He took part with the International Forces in the occupation of
the Island of Crete, and was there raised to the rank of Major. During
the South African War, he joined the Canadian Contingent, and won his
D.S.O. with other honors, during the several engagements of the
campaign. In command of a regiment of mounted infantry he shared in
conflict after conflict with the Boers, taking part in the relief of
Kimberley, and in the engagements of Paardeberg, Poplar Grove,
Prefontaine, Johannesburg, Pretoria and Diamond Hill, and many others.
After serving in Nigeria, he was given the rank of Lieut.-Colonel, his
name from time to time occurring in the dispatches to the War Office. As
an interruption to his service in Nigeria, he was called to China during
the Boxer uprising, and was present at the relief of Pekin by the
International Forces. On his return from China, he was appointed by the
War Office to the South African Intelligence Department, and became an
A.D.C. to the King. Later on he was gazetted as Inspector-General of the
West African Field Force, with the rank of Brigadier-General, a position
he was holding when Germany declared war in 1914. Since then he has
gained further distinction and promotion. With a combined force of
French and English troops numbering nearly ten thousand, he shared in
the conquest of the German Colony of the Cameroons, a territory covering
an area in all of 300,000 square miles. On New Year’s Day, 1916, the
order of C.M.G. was bestowed upon him by King George, and eventually, at
the close of the Cameroon Expedition, he received the honor of K.C.B.,
as well as the Legion of Honor from the President of the French
Republic, being at the same time gazetted as a Major-General of the
British Army. A still later event in his career as a “soldier of the
king” led to his being placed in command as Lieut.-General of the Coast
Forces that were to advance from the Suez Canal into Palestine.
Altogether Sir Charles Dobell’s career has been a splendid one. Hailing
as he does from a district in Canada that has provided several military
officers of high rank to the forces of the Motherland, his
fellow-Canadians cannot but be proud of the record made by one of their
own as a soldier and commander. He was married in 1908, to Mrs. (Elsye
Bankes) Campbell, daughter of the late Lieut.-Colonel Meyrick Bankes, of
London, and widow of Captain F. L. Campbell, R.N. His two brothers, Mr.
William Molson Dobell, lumber merchant, and Mr. Alfred Dobell, advocate,
as well as his uncle, Mr. William Molson Macpherson, banker, are
prominent citizens of the city of Quebec.

=Garneau, Sir George=, formerly Mayor of Quebec City, and one of the
prominent merchants and capitalists of that city, who has been for many
years President of the National Battlefields Commission, is a son of the
late Hon. Pierre Garneau, Member of the Legislative Council of the
Province of Quebec, and several times member of the Provincial Cabinet.
On the mother’s side he was a grandson of Mr. Edward Burroughs, the
Prothonotary. Sir George is a native of Quebec, having been born on
November 19, 1864. He received his earlier education at the Quebec
Seminary, afterwards entering as a student the Montreal Polytechnic
School, where he graduated as Civil Engineer, in 1884. Four years
afterwards he took the degree of Bachelor of Applied Science in Laval
University, where for a period he was Titular Professor of Analytical
Chemistry. For a time he held the position of assistant engineer on the
construction staff of the Quebec and Lake St. John Railway, previous to
his being taken in as a partner in his father’s wholesale dry goods
establishment. Aside from his business pursuits, he identified himself
with civic affairs, and on being elected alderman, he was chosen as
Mayor in 1906, and at the close of his term was unanimously re-elected
for a second term of two years. It was while he was Mayor that he became
Chairman of the National Battlefields Commission, in 1908. During that
year there occurred the Tercentennial Celebration of the founding of
Quebec. In association with Earl Grey, he was prominently identified
with the supervision of the preliminaries to that Celebration, and has
since deeply interested himself, with his associate Commissioners, in
the laying out of the Battlefields Park, which is still in course of
completion as one of the most striking of Canada’s historic landmarks.
His zeal as an overseer of that enterprise and the interest he took in
the events of the Celebration, graced, as it was, by the presence of the
Prince of Wales, now King George V, and other notables of Canada and the
Motherland, was signalized by the honor of knighthood at the hands of
King Edward VII, an honor subsequently supplemented by the President of
the French Republic, in the bestowal of the Legion of Honor. On the
creation of the Quebec Public Utilities Commission, in 1910, he was
appointed member of the same and acting President, the appointment being
extended for a period of ten years. His career has been marked by the
holding of many other high positions connected with the progress of his
native city. For a time he was a Director of the Railway Company, under
which he had been in his earlier years a civil engineer. He has been
Director of the Prudential Trust Company, a Director of the Quebec
Steamship Company, a member of the Advisory Board of the Richelieu and
Ontario Navigation Company, a Director of the Quebec Land Company, and a
Governor of Laval University. His brother, the Hon. E. B. Garneau, was
appointed to the Legislative Council on the death of his father. Since
the demise of both of them, Sir George has continued to be President of
the firm of “Garneau Limited.” He was married in 1892, to Miss Alma
Benoit, daughter of Alphonse Benoit, for many years Secretary of the
Department of Militia and Defence of Canada. His family consists of five
sons and three daughters. In these later years Sir George has taken a
deep interest in the Entente Conferences for the promotion of unity
between the two distinctive races of Canada; and during the Toronto
Conference, he was received at a special Convocation of the University
of Toronto, and had the honor of LL.D. conferred upon him. The ancestors
of the Garneau family came originally from France in 1663; and the
subject of this sketch as a French-Canadian, using the French and
English languages with equal facility, has never failed to acknowledge
himself as an all-Canadian, devoted to the cause of a common
Canadianism, under the aegis of the British Empire. He also served in
the Canadian Militia, from which he retired with the rank of Captain of
Field Artillery in 1894.

=Cox, Herbert Coplin= (Toronto, Ont.), son of the late Hon. George A.
Cox, Senator, and Margaret (Hopkins) Cox, was born at Peterborough,
Ont., on June 29, 1873, and received his education at Jarvis Street
Collegiate Institute and Victoria University, Toronto. Mr. Cox was
trained to business life and in an extensive experience under his father
early developed aptitude and ability as a financier. In July, 1895, he
married Louise Bogart Brown, daughter of Charles Brown, Toronto. On
completing his education Mr. Cox entered the service of the Canada Life
Assurance Company and rapidly rose to the management of the company’s
largest branch. He entered into partnership with his father under the
firm name of George A. & H. C. Cox, in the management of the Eastern
Ontario and Michigan branches of the company in July, 1899, and became
sole manager of the business of that territory upon his father’s
appointment to the presidency. In October, 1912, he was invited to
accept the presidency of the Imperial Life Assurance Company, where he
obtained an invaluable experience in executive work. He retired from
this position in August, 1914, to become President of the Canada Life
Assurance Company on the death of his brother, E. W. Cox. He also
assumed the responsibility of various other offices and directorates
held by his late brother. While, however, his career as an insurance man
and financier has been such as very few men of his age have attained,
that represents but one side of a character remarkable for activity and
public spirit, as well as ability. In movements toward the betterment of
conditions in the life insurance business Mr. Cox has naturally taken a
keen interest, but his pursuits outside of business, especially in the
field of social betterment, are varied and important. He took a deep and
active interest in the erection of Toronto’s General Hospital, serving
upon several committees in this connection. He is a director of the
Toronto Conservatory of Music and is a member of the Music Committee of
the Metropolitan Church, of which he is also a trustee. He is likewise
chairman of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, and Honorary Colonel of the
Mississauga Horse. Mr. Cox is President and General Manager of the
Canada Life Assurance Company, President of the Imperial Guarantee and
Accident Company, President of the Toronto Savings and Loan Company,
President of the Provident Investment Company, Vice-President of the
Central Canada Loan and Savings Company, Director of the Dominion
Securities Corporation, Director of the National Trust Company, Director
of the Canadian General Electric Company, Director of the British
American Assurance Company, Director of the Western Assurance Company,
Director of the Dunlop Tire and Rubber Company, and Director of the
Robert Simpson Company. He is a member of the following clubs: Toronto,
York, Toronto Hunt, Toronto Golf, Mississauga Golf, Royal Canadian
Yacht, National, Ontario, Arts and Letters. In religion Mr. Cox is a
Methodist.

=Casgrain, Philippe Baby= (Quebec City), lawyer, parliamentarian and
author, is of an old and distinguished family, which includes in its
record besides himself, the late Abbé P. H. Casgrain, of literary fame;
the Hon. Senator Charles E. C. Casgrain, M.D.; the Hon. Thomas Chase
Casgrain, the distinguished lawyer and Minister of the Crown, and the
Hon. Senator J. P. B. Casgrain. The subject of this sketch was born in
the city of Quebec, on the 30th December, 1826. He is the son of Mr. C.
E. C. Casgrain, who was at one time the Deputy Commissioner of Public
Works. His mother’s maiden name was Miss Anne Baby, a daughter of the
Hon. James Baby, Cabinet Minister. He had his earlier education at St.
Anne’s College. In 1850 he was called to the Bar, and was given his K.C.
in his thirty-third year, after being associated as a law-partner with
the Hon. Mr. Cauveau, the Solicitor-General of his time. After this he
was given a position as assistant in the Prothonotary’s Office, and was
later on chosen Clerk of the Circuit Court. Subsequently he was elected
a member of the House of Commons for the constituency of L’Islet, which
he continued to represent from term to term for nearly twenty years. It
was not until 1891 he was defeated by Mr. Georges Desjardins. During his
parliamentary days he was ever diligent in assuming his share of
committee work, having taken a prominent part in the Royal Commission
appointed to investigate the administration of public affairs in the
constituency of Rimouski. Two years after his defeat in L’Islet, he was
given the presidency of a second Royal Commission to enquire into the
affairs of the Montreal and Sorel Railway. During his long term of
office in the Court House, he gained a prominence as a writer and
investigator of the traditions that fringed the historical atmosphere of
his native city. He was elected for a term of two years President of the
Literary and Historical Society in 1898, and seven years afterwards he
was chosen for the same position a second time. He also was a member of
the Navy League, and took an active part in securing the Plains of
Abraham as a federal asset, thus preparing the way for its becoming a
permanent acquisition of the National Battlefields Parks Commission. In
1907 he was elected Vice-President of the Canadian Landmarks
Association, and was later awarded a diploma from the Royal Society of
Canada for his zeal in archæological research. The Transactions of the
Royal Society and of the Literary and Historical Society bear testimony
to his industry in preparing historical and antiquarian matter for
publication, which otherwise might have been lost. For instance, he
successfully located the site of the fountain from which the founder of
the colony, Samuel de Champlain, had water drawn to supply his
habitation, as well as the site of the house in which General Montcalm
lived during his sojourn in Quebec, and the house in which he died; the
site of the place of abode of Abraham Martin, whose name is perpetuated
in the name of the historic battlefield; the site of Dumont’s Mill, near
the baylet curvature of the St. Lawrence known as Wolfe’s Cove; the
location of Claire Fontaine, that gave its name to the street which, as
an elevated pathway on the brow of Perrault’s Hill, saw the marshalling
of Montcalm’s troops in three divisions; besides the locations of many
other historical landmarks in the Ancient Capital. Learned in the law,
he was held in high respect as an official of the Palais de Justice. His
long tenure of office in Parliament and out of it has always been
characterized by integrity of purpose in dealing with public matters.

=Cole, Wilmot Howard, ex-M.L.A., Colonel= (Brockville, Ont.), was born
at Brockville, February 16, 1834. The patronymic Cole is of very ancient
Saxon origin: It appears in the “Domesday Book.” The public records show
that in the year 1640, Sir John Cole, of Shenley, in Hertfordshire,
England, was a landed proprietor. His son, Adam, married and had issue a
son, Cornelius. This Cornelius Cole emigrated to America in the year
1708; in 1711 he became a justice of Albany County comprised within the
limits of what was called “Livingston Manor.” His land was next to that
of W. T. Livingston, and extended from the Manor House road to Jansens’s
Kill, or creek, and was one of the finest farms in the Manor. He had
three sons, named Nicholas, John and Adam. On the breaking out of the
rebellion, Cornelius Cole and his sons, John and Adam, espoused the
cause of England, and the sons joined the Royalist forces. As the war
proceeded the feeling ran so high against the “Tories,” as the Royalists
were called, and Cornelius Cole, although an old man, was seized and
imprisoned, where he died a victim of fidelity to Motherland. His
property was confiscated, and his sons forced to seek a home in the
wilds of Canada. In 1773 John and Adam Cole with his wife and her two
brothers, Jonathan, Jr., and Abel Fulford, left with other United Empire
Loyalists for Canada, and passing up the St. Lawrence, they landed and
settled in the County of Leeds, in that part now called the Township of
Elizabethtown, at a point on the River St. Lawrence about five miles
west of the present town of Brockville, which place is still called
“Cole’s Ferry.” Here Adam Cole settled, being, as he was frequently
heard to say, the first person to begin a settlement in the Township of
Elizabethtown. Some years after the close of the war, Peter, a son of
John Cole, returned to his grandfather’s old home in Ulster County, to
ascertain whether he could recover some of the family estate, which had
been confiscated, but failed, as the authorities had granted the
property to other persons. Adam Cole’s wife was Thankful Fulford, also
descended from Loyalist stock. Her father, Jonathan Fulford, sen., with
the rest of his family came in 1784, and settled in the same
neighborhood, and left numerous descendants. Adam Cole’s family, in
1812, consisted of nine sons and seven daughters, besides four who died
in infancy. Five of the sons served in the War of 1812, the eldest,
Peter, having assisted in the capture of Ogdensburg, and subsequently
held the rank of captain. The house of Adam Cole was the general
headquarters of the military, when they were in that section of country,
or when moving between Montreal and Kingston. It is related of Peter
Cole, the eldest son, that in the year 1810, the mail carrier was taken
sick at his father’s house, and Peter took the mail to Kingston, where
he received that from Toronto and carried it back to Montreal. At
Montreal he took charge of the mail for the west, which had been
accumulating for a month and weighed upwards of sixty pounds, and
carried it to Kingston. He accomplished the whole trip, going and
coming, of 430 miles on foot, in fourteen days, and this was in March,
when the trail most of the way was through the forest and very
difficult. He received for this service, from the Government the sum of
fifteen dollars. Abel Cole, who was the youngest son of Adam Cole, died
December 9, 1893, aged 88 years. His wife, Catherine Seaman, a
grand-daughter of Caleb Seaman, died Nov. 2, 1893, aged 83 years, being
one of the sons of Caleb Seaman who was with Lord Cornwallis at York
Town. Wilmot Howard Cole, second son of Abel Cole, was educated at
Brockville. He commenced mercantile business in 1855, and continued in
the same until 1882. The old spirit of loyalty which he inherited,
prompted him upon the organization of the Volunteer Militia of Canada in
1855, to become a member of the old “Brockville Rifle Company,”
commanded by Major Smythe (later of the 100th Regiment, British Army).
The late Col. James Crawford, William Fitzsimmons (a former postmaster
of Brockville), the late Samuel Ross, William Morris, Thomas Camm and
other business men of Brockville, shouldered their muskets and learned
the drill at the same time. Wilmot Howard Cole filled every position in
rank from private to colonel of battalion. In December, 1864, he went
with the Brockville Rifle Company, as lieutenant, to Amherstburg, in the
County of Essex, remaining there on duty until the following May. In
November, 1865, the fear of a Fenian Raid was so strong in the vicinity
of the River St. Lawrence, that the officers of the Brockville Rifle
Company (who were at the time, the late Col. Crawford in command, Lieut.
Cole, Lieut. Robert Bowie, and the late Lieut. Windeat), offered their
services without pay, and to increase their company to 100 men to do
duty for the protection of Brockville and vicinity, by drilling the men
and mounting a heavy guard every night, with sentries posted in
different parts of the town, the men only being paid twenty-five cents
per day. The offer was accepted by the government and that duty
performed until the ensuing March, when a large portion of the volunteer
force were called out, and a provisional battalion formed at Brockville,
under command of Col. Crawford, Lieut. Cole assuming command of the
Brockville Rifle Company, with which he remained on duty until the next
November, part of the time at Brockville and part at Cornwall. Again in
1870, as major of the 41st battalion, he was on duty at Cornwall during
the Fenian excitement. On June 28, 1871, he was appointed to the command
of the 41st battalion; on June 28, 1898, he resigned, having held the
command for 27 years, and was a member of the active force for 43 years.
In 1913 the Militia Department honored him with the full rank of
Colonel. Col. Cole occupied various positions of trust and importance in
the gift of his fellow-citizens. He was a member of the Town Council of
Brockville for fourteen years; a director for many years, and president
of the Johnstown Mutual Fire Insurance Company; a member of the
Independent Order of Oddfellows for many years, filling various offices
in the local lodge and also in the Grand lodge and Grand Encampment. He
was chosen by his brethren to fill the position of Grand Master the year
the Sovereign Grand Lodge met in Toronto, in September, 1880, who were
entertained by their Ontario brethren. He always took an active part in
everything that would advance the interests of his native town. In
connection with the late Allan Turner, he worked for many years to
obtain a system of waterworks for Brockville, and in 1881 they organized
a company, consisting of Allan Turner, John McMullen, Thomas Gilmour,
George A. Dana, and Wilmot H. Cole, to construct waterworks; and as a
result of the efforts of these gentlemen, Brockville has now a most
excellent system of water supply for all purposes. Colonel Cole was
elected a member of the Legislature of the Province of Ontario for the
Brockville riding, in the Liberal interest, at the general elections in
1875, and was a warm supporter of the Mowat Government. He received the
appointment of Registrar for the County of Leeds in February, 1882. He
was president of the Brockville Loan and Savings Company. Col. Cole was
a member of the Methodist Church, and for over fifty years a trustee of
the Wall Street Church in Brockville, and was looked upon by his fellow
church members as ready to assist in carrying forward all enterprises
for the benefit of the church. Col. Cole married Jane Adelaide, youngest
daughter of the late Abram Philips, of New York. Their family consisted
of four children, two sons and two daughters. The sons, following the
traditions of the family, entered the volunteer force very early. The
elder, Eugene Maurice Cole, was bugler in the Brockville Rifle Company
in 1866, and did duty with that company whenever on service; he
subsequently became lieutenant, after which he resigned, having removed
from Brockville. The youngest son, Capt. George Marshall Cole, was
captain of No. 4 company, 41st battalion. The latest enterprise which
Col. Cole had been connected with and will eventually benefit his native
town more than all the others, was the Brockville, Westport and Sault
Ste. Marie Railway. The idea of a railway from Brockville to Westport
had been entertained, and a charter was procured, but nothing further
was done, and after a time the charter expired. Subsequently, Eugene M.
Cole, who was in business in New York City, and enjoyed commercial
relations with gentlemen interested in building railways and other
public works, conceived the idea that a line of railway from Brockville
to Sault Ste. Marie would prove an advantageous route in many ways, and
at the same time benefit his native town. After much labor in gathering
statistical information, he laid the whole matter before his father, who
had it brought before the leading men of the County of Leeds, and the
proposition made that if the municipalities would bear the expense of
preliminary survey and obtain the charter, and grant aid by way of bonus
to the extent of $125,000, Eugene M. Cole would work up the scheme and
obtain the capital and contractors to build at least the first section
of the road to Westport. This was agreed to, the last bonus by-law being
passed on July 15, 1885, and work on the construction of the railway
commenced on January 13, 1886. Although ably assisted by many persons in
the County of Leeds in connection with the enterprise, the credit of the
inception of the scheme, and the labor in working it up materially and
financially, belong to Eugene M. Cole. Colonel Cole died December 13,
1915, in his eighty-second year, being pre-deceased by his wife by about
two months.

=Scott, James Guthrie=, the prominent railway manager of Quebec City,
was born in that city on February 13, 1847, the son of Hugh Erskine
Scott. His mother’s maiden name was Margaret Chillas. The family of the
Scotts has filled an important place in the community since the days of
Mr. Scott’s grandfather, who came from Scotland. Mr. Henry S. Scott,
hardware merchant, was his uncle, and Mr. William C. Scott and Mr.
Charles Scott, his brothers, all of whom took an active interest in the
progress of the city, as has their distinguished relative. The latter
received his early education at the Quebec High School. In his
seventeenth year he had his first start in business in the offices of
the Montmorency Lumber Mills, where he eventually became head of one of
the departments. In 1879, he entered the service of the Quebec and Lake
St. John Railway, becoming, in time, its general manager and assuming
the onerous task of having that line completed as far as Chicoutimi and
extended, under the name of the Great Northern, to Hawkesbury, Ont.,
across the Ottawa, a distance in all of five hundred miles. But for Mr.
Scott’s supervisory tact and engineering skill, Quebec would hardly have
become the important railway terminal that it now is, not only of the
Canadian Northern System, but of the National Transcontinental. During
the earlier operations of the Quebec and Lake St. John Railway, Mr.
Scott and his Board of Directors organized a system of assisted
colonization that peopled the parishes all along their line, as many as
from ten to twelve thousand families being induced to take up homesteads
in the districts opened up for settlement. For twenty-five years Mr.
Scott was _facile princeps_ in these beneficent operations; and it was
only when the Canadian Northern Railway Company took over the properties
supervised by him in 1908, that he decided to retire from office to take
up other work involving the commercial advancement of his native city.
In 1916 he was elected President of the Quebec Board of Trade, after
many years of active service as one of its members, and is also
President of the British Columbia Skeena Coal Company. For many years he
has been a member of the Quebec Geographical Society and other
associations; and his contemporaries can look back with satisfaction at
the civic progress he awakened as a railway projector and business man,
and the manufacturing centres he succeeded in locating from the time he
undertook to complete the Lake St. John Railway. In June, 1908, upon his
retirement from the management of the railway, he was given a banquet by
the citizens of Quebec at the Chateau Frontenac, in recognition of the
enterprising and successful work he had done while completing extensions
north and west from the city, and at the same time was presented with
testimonials of value. And in addition to the story of his life as a
railway manager and projector, Mr. Scott has to his credit twelve years’
service in the Militia, having been called out to frustrate the advance
of the enemy in certain border raids near Windsor, Ontario, in 1865, as
well as to protect Canada from the Fenian Raids, during the four years

=Bender, Prosper, M.D.=, and Litterateur (Quebec City), was born in
Quebec on July 30, 1844. He was the son of L. P. Bender, Advocate, his
mother’s maiden name having been Miss Jane McMillan. His school
education began at the Quebec Seminary and was continued at Laval
University, where he went through a successful course in _belles
lettres_ and collateral studies. Thereafter he entered McGill
University, where in 1864 he took his degree of M.D. On the following
year he entered upon his career as a medical man in his native city,
where, in 1868, he married Miss Amelia Scott, daughter of A. S. Scott.
At the time of his graduation, the Civil War between the Northern and
Southern States of the American Republic was nearing its climax, and in
the excitement of events an opportunity offered itself to the young
student to mature his skill in surgery and the healing art on the
battlefield. He was given employment in the army in North Virginia,
which was then under the command of General Ulysses Grant. As an
assistant surgeon he remained with that army up to the time of General
Lee’s surrender, his faithfulness and skill bringing him to the notice
of his medical associates and eventually to the notice of the General in
person. After the war, Dr. Bender proceeded to New York to gain further
professional experience in the hospitals, before entering upon the first
period of his residence in Quebec as a medical practitioner. During that
period he came into touch with several of the rising public men of the
town, who made a kind of literary rendezvous of his residence, much as
years afterwards the Circle de Dix used to hold their seances out at
Spencer Wood, under the hospital auspices of Sir Adolphe Chapleau. The
social gatherings at Dr. Bender’s had no doubt the effect of turning the
attention of the successful physician to literary work, leading him to
publish two volumes, respectfully titled, “Literary Sheaves,” and “Old
and New Canada.” In 1884 he removed to Boston, where he practised as a
homeopathist, and won a reputation among the literary men of that city,
as a contributor to the magazines and reviews. Within the last ten years
preceding his death in 1917, he had his residence again in Quebec.
During these years he published in amplified form a series of sketches
about the friends of his earlier comradeship. These sketches embodied
the characteristics of the brilliant literary guests who had once met
round his table, and were read with the greatest of interest by the
public as they appeared from time to time, as an illustration of the
author’s geniality of spirit and literary acumen. Altogether, Dr.
Prosper Bender’s professional and literary career stood as a blend of
duly recognized medical skill and critical literary insight, holding
always the confidence of his patients and being widely esteemed for his
bonhomie and intellectuality as a writer of books worth reading.

=Douglas, James= (Hepworth, Ontario), son of James Douglas, Roxborough,
Scotland, and Isabella Dixon, Lauderdale, Scotland, was born in the
township of Brant, Bruce County, in August, 1858. Here he spent his
early days, receiving his education in the public schools. For a time he
followed farming as an occupation. However, he was inclined towards
mercantile pursuits and gave up the farm to become a general merchant at
Dobbington, in the township of Elderslie. The lumbering business
attracted his attention and he gave up the store for that occupation,
which was extensively carried on in those early days in Bruce. In 1902
he moved to the village of Hepworth, where he became Vice-President of
the Hepworth Manufacturing Co., and also manager. Here he has resided
ever since, successfully conducting the business he is connected with.
Beside this he is interested in a number of other enterprises, being a
director of the Canada Beds Co., of Chesley, and a shareholder in the
Vincent Steel Process Co., of Detroit. He has always had a love for
municipal life, and for eight years has served the village of Hepworth
as reeve in a most competent manner. As a member of the County Council
he has served on most of the prominent committees, but the Educational
Committee has always been his favorite. Being a self-educated man, he
strove hard for the vast fund of knowledge he has acquired. This has
made him a warm friend toward all branches of education, and he is ever
ready to forward its best interests. His ripe business judgment has ever
been recognized by his colleagues in the County Council. He is a man of
genial disposition and well liked by all. He is a member of Burns Lodge,
No. 436, A.F. & A.M., Hepworth. In religion he is a Presbyterian, and in
politics he is a Liberal. He was twice married, his first wife being
Francis Bradley, daughter of John Bradley, of Greenock township.

=Pardee, Frederick Forsyth, K.C., M.P.= (Sarnia, Ont.), son of the late
Hon. Timothy Blair Pardee and Emma K. Pardee, _née_ Forsyth, was born at
Sarnia, Ontario, on December 29, 1867, and was educated at the Sarnia
School and at Upper Canada College. He subsequently entered the study of
Law and graduated at Osgoode Hall, being called to the Bar in 1890. He
was created a King’s Counsel in 1908, and became head of the law firm of
Pardee, Burnham & Gurd. In his student days and in the earlier years of
his professional career he took a keen interest in various athletics and
was a cricket player of note. He married, on December 31, 1892, Mary E.
Johnston, daughter of Hugh Johnston, and to them was born one daughter,
Pauline L. Early in life Mr. Pardee began to interest himself in public
problems and public affairs, and in 1898, when but 31 years of age, he
was chosen as Liberal candidate for the provincial riding of West
Lambton, being elected to the Legislature of Ontario the same year. He
sat in the Provincial House until 1902, when he was defeated by Hon. W.
J. Hanna, who subsequently became Provincial Secretary in the first
cabinet of Sir James Whitney. In the Dominion by-election of November
22, 1905, made necessary by the death of Dr. Johnston, the sitting
member, Mr. Pardee was chosen by the electors of West Lambton to
represent them in the Dominion House of Commons. He was re-elected at
the general elections of 1908 and 1911. In November, 1909, on the
nomination of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, then Prime Minister of Canada, he was
unanimously chosen as Chief Government Whip, and still retains the
important position of Chief Liberal Whip to the present time (1917). In
the Dominion Parliament, as well as throughout the country, Mr. Pardee’s
public work soon won him a position of usefulness and responsibility. He
is a forceful and effective public speaker, and few public men are so
universally popular and so highly esteemed. During his parliamentary
career he has presided over, and served upon, many of the most important
legislative committees of the House of Commons and Senate. In 1910 he
was chosen by Sir Wilfrid Laurier to accompany him on his memorable tour
through the Canadian West, making the first visit with the then Prime
Minister to the new Pacific port of Prince Rupert. When, in 1911, the
Administration of Sir Wilfrid Laurier was defeated at the polls upon the
issue of reciprocal trade in natural products with the United States,
and the Liberal party passed into Opposition, Mr. Pardee continued as
Chief Whip and had a large share in the arduous parliamentary and
organization work which ensued. Following the outbreak of the great war
it was he who defined in Parliament, amid hearty approval from both
sides of the House, the patriotic obligations which devolved upon
Government and Opposition. He devoted his time and energy, both in the
House and out of it, to patriotic endeavor, addressing recruiting
rallies and contributing to the various national efforts of service and
sacrifice. He moved in Parliament for the appointment of a special
committee to consider national steps to recompense and aid returning
wounded and maimed soldiers and was named by the House as a member of
that committee. In 1918 he resigned the post of Liberal Whip and
supported Sir Robert Borden on the question of Conscription, but
declined a portfolio in the Union Government. In the general elections
of that year he was again re-elected for West Lambton by a handsome
majority. Mr. Pardee is strongly democratic in spirit, and during the
parliamentary session of 1913-14, made a vigorous plea to the House
against the indiscriminate bestowal of titles in Canada, and issued a
warning against the danger of creating a pseudo-aristocracy in this
young Dominion. In religion he is an Anglican and is a member of St.
George’s Church, Sarnia.

=Bronson, Henry Franklin= (Ottawa, Ont.), the one man, it has been said,
who understood the feasibility of converting the large lakes and furious
foaming falls of the Ottawa River into a channel for the driving of
saw-logs, was born in the town of Moreau, Saratoga County, New York
State, on February 24, 1817. His parents were Alvah Bronson and Sarah
Tinker. Mr. Bronson is of mixed Scottish and Welsh descent, and the
family, which is now scattered through most of the Northern States, at
an early period settled in New England. Members of this enterprising and
clever family were the Hon. Greene C. Bronson, of the New York bench,
and the Rev. Asa Bronson, who was for many years pastor of the First
Baptist Church, at Fall River, Massachusetts. The first of the family to
find his way to Canada was the subject of our sketch, and shortly after
he came here he led off in the lumber business. H. F. Bronson spent his
youthful days at Queensbury, Warren County, New York, in the family of
the late J. J. Harris, and he concluded his education at the Poultney
Academy, of Vermont. “Young Bronson,” says a reliable authority, “became
an apt scholar in agricultural sciences, but soon showed a preference
for woodland foraging, pre-destined, as he was, to become a great
marauder of pine forests.” In 1840, Mr. Harris, already alluded to,
purchased extensive pine tracts, erecting mills on one of the upper
Hudson lakes. He formed a partnership with his young and trusted friend,
Mr. Bronson, “whose assets consisted of a sound constitution, a resolute
will, unbending integrity, skill with the hand, and a mind to work.” The
partnership continued for twenty-two years, and during the last ten
years of the association, the greater portion of the business
responsibility fell upon our subject, owing to the failure of Mr.
Harris’ health. It soon became plain that the pine was rapidly
disappearing from the upper Hudson; therefore, in 1848, Mr. Bronson
passed over to Canada, proceeding along the Ottawa Valley till the
thunder of the Chaudiere Falls burst upon his ears. At once he was
satisfied that here was an excellent place to begin lumber operations;
for the timber seemed inexhaustible, and the water power magnificent. He
returned home, but in 1852 he persuaded Mr. Harris to accompany him to
the Ottawa Valley. When they reached again the region of kingly pines
and booming waterfalls, they were everywhere met with testimony from
river experts, saying that the Ottawa was not suitable for the safe
driving of saw logs, but Mr. Bronson recommended to his partner the
purchase of hydraulic lots at the Chaudiere Falls, then held by the
Crown. At the sale of the lots, made by Mr. Horace Merrill, general
superintendent of the Ottawa River works, a purchase was made, and here,
under the personal supervision of Mr. Bronson, their mills were built
within sound of the thunder of the falls. The mills having been erected,
Mr. Bronson removed his family to Ottawa, and there they were
established permanently. The relation of Mr. Bronson to the sawn lumber
trade of the Dominion of Canada will be better understood when it is
learned that his was the first movement in the Ottawa District for the
manufacture of sawn lumber for the United States market. The original
mill embodied all the modern improvements of the times, including iron
gates of novel model, a contrivance planned by Mr. Bronson himself, and
afterwards used in most of the gang saw mills on the Ottawa River.
Several other gentlemen, stimulated by the enterprise and success of Mr.
Bronson and his partner, likewise set out for Ottawa; and, after a time,
chiefly owing to the persistency of Mr. Bronson, a series of costly
river improvements were constructed, which made the driving of logs upon
the Ottawa a matter of greater convenience than upon many a smaller
stream, which has no large lakes to act as a reservoir for checking the
fury of the spring freshets. In 1864, Mr. Harris retired from the
business, Mr. Bronson still continuing the extensive manufacture of sawn
lumber, and owing to his splendid abilities as a manager, his operations
not alone maintained their ground, but gradually increased. The present
firm at Ottawa is known as The Bronson Company. Mr. Bronson married, on
November 5, 1840, Editha E. Pierce, of Bolton, N.Y., and had four
children. Gertrude, the only daughter, is the wife of Levi Crannell. The
sons are Erskine Henry, Frank P., and Walter G. The family are members
of the Presbyterian Church. Mr. Bronson, like another great prince of
business men, Sir Hugh Allan, did not care for political life, and held
himself aloof from parties, but he was connected with several benevolent
institutions and business enterprises. In 1889, death called this
pioneer Canadian lumberman and high-principled citizen. His private and
social relations had won for him everywhere good will and highest
regard. Men had learned to esteem the man because of his tested and
sterling worth. In the commerce of Canada Mr. Bronson’s name will go
down in history as the first lumberman in the Ottawa Valley to
manufacture sawn lumber for the American market, and as a pioneer in the
development of the resources of that section of Canada to the point
where its principal city was deemed worthy of being named as the Capital
City of the Dominion. Business courage and keenness of perception were
required to accomplish these ends, but in more ways than one Mr. Bronson
had shown himself to be a man of practical vision and rare foresight. To
men like the late Henry Franklin Bronson, Canada and in particular the
business life of the Capital, must ever remain in debt.

early age of 34, he was created K.C., and practised, successfully, his
profession in Montreal from 1898 until 1902, when he located in Ottawa,
and has since established a wide and ever increasing clientele in that
city. His brilliant defence saved Laderoute from the gallows in the
Bryson murder trial of 1906, and Blondin (charged with murdering Dr.
Empey) at L’Orignal, in 1910. He was Councillor of the Ontario Bar
Association from 1910 to 1913; President of L’Institut Canadien

candidate for Parliament. He is the author of the work on the Quebec Law
of Landlord and Tenant and writes frequently for the French and English
Press. In April, 1914, the French Government, in recognition of Mr.
Lemieux’s proficiency in French literature, conferred on him the
decoration of “Officier d’Académie” (Academic Palms), through Monsieur

=Chadwick, Edward Marion, K.C.= (Toronto, Ont.), was born at Cravendale,
Township of Ancaster, Ont., Sept. 22, 1840, and is the third son of the
late John Craven Chadwick, Guelph, Ont. He received a thorough
scholastic training. The bend of his mind being in the direction of the
law, he pursued his studies therefor, and was called to the Bar and
associated himself with the late W. H. Beatty, and has been a partner in
the firms successively formed by him in which many prominent members of
the legal profession have been partners, during a period of more than
fifty years, the firms being recognized as among the most important
engaged in their profession in Ontario. While perhaps it is unnecessary
to say anything here as to Mr. Chadwick’s ability as an author, we
cannot refrain from noting the publication of a work entitled “Ontarian
Families” (1894), being the genealogies of United Empire Loyalist and
other pioneer families of Upper Canada; he has also been a writer for
magazines on heraldic subjects, in which he is reputed to be the leading
authority on this side of the Atlantic. Mr. Chadwick was for a number of
years an officer in the Queen’s Own Rifles, retiring in 1882, with the
rank of Major. For the last forty years Mr. Chadwick has been identified
with church work, being an indefatigable worker, and he at present holds
the important office of Treasurer of St. Alban’s Cathedral.

Chairman of the Public Library Board, and is a member of the Masonic,
Oddfellows and Orange Orders. He is an adherent of the Church of
England, and a Liberal-Conservative in politics. Recognizing the
usefulness of the Cadet movement he has taken the course prescribed for
instructors and the Orangeville High School Cadets have attained much
efficiency under his direction. Principal Hackett is a man in the prime
of life, well informed on all matters of national importance, and gives
generously of his time and talents in the promotion of the best
interests of the community, in which he occupies so important a
position. His chief recreation is motoring.

=Hunter, Lt.-Col. A. T.= (Toronto, Ont.), was born on the 25th of
October, 1869, and after having received a thorough primary and
elementary education at the public and high schools, he entered the
Toronto University where, in 1890, he had the distinction of having the
degree of LL.B. conferred upon him. He was duly admitted to the Bar in
1892 and at once embarked in the active practice of his profession, in
which, he has been very successful. He maintains a handsome suite of
offices at 706 Temple Building, Bay and Richmond Streets, where he
enjoys a large and lucrative practice, his services being constantly
retained by some of the leading firms and corporations of the city and
province. Colonel Hunter is prominently identified with the Masonic
craft, and is an active and influential member of the I.O.F., A.O.U.W.,
and a Past Master of L.O.L. No. 613. As an author Colonel Hunter is well
known, and among the works emanating from his pen may be named “Power of
Sale Under Mortgage,” “Foreclosure Under Mortgage,” and “Real Property
Statutes.” The Colonel, prior to this war, was courageous in pointing
out in speeches and contributions to the “Military Gazette,” absurdities
in our military organization. Colonel Hunter has devoted some time to
politics and was candidate for the riding of West Toronto in the
Dominion House, of the McCarthyites in 1896, and of the Liberals in
1904. In 1914, when war was declared by Germany on England and her
colonies, Colonel Hunter at once responded to the call to duty, laid
aside his business and other connections, and went overseas with the 4th
Battalion C.E.F. On April 23, 1915, he was wounded in the battle of St.
Julien, but returned to duty in time for the battle of Festubert; after
this he was placed on duty in England, and later returned to Canada on
leave of absence; while in Canada he acted as Brigade-Major at Camp
Borden in 1916. He again returned to England on active service, and in
February, 1917, was attached to the Princess Patricias on service in
France and was present with them at Vimy Ridge. He returned to Canada in
November of same year and has been gazetted Lt.-Colonel of the 12th
Regt. York Rangers.

=Groves, Abraham, M.D.= (Fergus, Ont.), was born in the town of
Peterboro’, on Sept. 8, 1847. He is a son of Abraham Groves, and
Margaret, daughter of Gideon Gibson, one of the early pioneers of
Canada, who served through the war of 1812-15, and fought at Lundy’s
Lane. Mr. Groves came to this country with his parents from the County
of Wicklow, Ireland, about 1826, and settled in the vicinity of
Peterboro’. In 1856 Mr. Groves removed to the County of Wellington,
taking up his abode in the Township of Garafraxa, where he pursued the
occupation of farmer. During the Mackenzie Rebellion Mr. Groves took
part on the Loyalists’ side. The fruit of the marriage was thirteen
children, the subject of this sketch being the second eldest of the
family. He at first attended the common schools, but afterwards entered
the High School at Fergus. Some time after leaving school he resolved to
study medicine, and in 1868 entered the Toronto School of Medicine,
where he remained until 1871, graduating M.D. in the same year, from the
Toronto University. After graduation he at once went to Fergus and
entered into partnership with the late Dr. Munro, under the firm name of
Munro & Groves, which partnership existed two years. After dissolution
Dr. Groves practised by himself until 1874, when he took into
partnership Dr. John Wishart, now lecturer at the Western University, at
London, Ont., which partnership existed one year, Dr. Wishart then
retiring. However, again in 1879, he took into partnership Dr. Thomas
Chisholm, the association continuing for a year. In 1882 he again took
another partner, Dr. J. F. McMahon, now of Toronto, but this combination
too dissolved in 1883, and since that time Dr. Groves has singly
conducted one of the largest practices in Fergus. In 1869 he graduated
from the old Toronto Military School; in 1882 he was elected to the
Village council of Fergus, and was re-elected for the years of 1883 and
1884. He was elected reeve for 1885, but owing to his position of
surgeon of the county poor house, he could not retain his seat. Dr.
Groves is largely interested in real estate in the village, owning some
of the finest buildings there, among which structures may be mentioned
the Royal Bank building, constructed of brown stone. He is a member of
the Mercer Lodge, A.F. and A.M., No. 347; is surgeon and member of the
Oddfellows’ lodge No. 73, and has held all of the offices in that order.
He is also a member of the Royal Templars, and physician to lodge No.
124. In 1878 Dr. Groves was appointed physician and surgeon to the Grand
Trunk Railway at Fergus, which position he still holds. In 1882 he was
appointed physician and surgeon to the Wellington County House of
Industry, and this office he still likewise retains. In politics he has
held aloof from parties, though sincerely interested in the welfare of
the country. He is a member of the Church of England, and has been
churchwarden for twelve years of St. James’ Church, Fergus. He married
in 1874, Jennie, daughter of the late William Gibbon, of Elora, and by
this lady has a family of two children; she died in 1886. On January 29,
1910, he married Ethel May Burke, only daughter of the late D. S. Burke,
Esq., of Fergus. Dr. Groves enjoys the repute of being a very skilful
surgeon, and he was the first to perform in Canada the operation
technically known to the profession as _supra pubic lithotomy_. In
January, 1901, he established, in Fergus, the Royal Alexandra Hospital,
which has already become widely known throughout Western Ontario. He
also installed the Fergus and Elora Electric Light Plant, since taken
over by the Hydro-Electric. In 1911 he was tendered by unanimous vote
the Conservative nomination for the House of Commons for the South
Riding of the County of Wellington, but the pressure of his professional
work prevented his accepting.

becoming one of the largest stock breeders in Ontario, and has imported
much of the finest breeding stock in the country during the past
thirty-five years. As a citizen and public man he is held in the highest
esteem, and has received the highest honors to be had from his home town
and surrounding localities. Having ambitions other than business, he
drifted into public life, and received the nomination as the Liberal
candidate for the House of Commons for West Durham in 1891 and was

high up in the ranks of both political parties, brought in from outside
places, among whom were the late Hon. Edward Blake and Mr. George Tate
Blackstock, one of the most learned legal lights in Canada. It has

the flags that stand for freedom against Prussianism.

during his undergraduate course, graduated in 1870, carrying off the
Prince of Wales’ prize for general proficiency, the gold medal in
moderns, a silver medal in classics, the French essay prize, and
first-class honors in history and ethnology. In 1884 he was elected by

first without an oral, both as barrister and as attorney; and at once
entered into partnership with his former principal, Mr. Macdougall, at
St. Thomas. The law firm of Macdougall & Coyne existed until 1880, when
it was dissolved. Shortly afterwards, Mr. Coyne entered into partnership
with J. Mann, under the firm name of Coyne & Mann. The partnership
continued until Mr. Coyne’s appointment in Dec., 1888, as Registrar for
the County of Elgin. During the Fenian excitement of 1866, Mr. Coyne
joined the St. Thomas Rifles, and served during three campaigns in that
year: First at London, during March, when some thousands of regulars and
volunteers were brigaded there; then at Port Stanley and Sarnia, in
June; and finally in camp at Thorold in August, where he acted as
quartermaster-sergeant to the Provisional Battalion of volunteers, who
were then brigaded with regulars and other volunteers under Wolseley. He
holds the Fenian Raid medal. The following year he joined the famous
University company of the Queen’s Own Rifles, of which he remained a
member until his graduation, with the degree of B.A., June, 1870. He
received the degree of M.A. (with honors) Toronto University, 1905, and
the degree of LL.D. (honorary) from Queen’s University, Kingston, 1909.
He was a member of the great Reform Convention, at Toronto, in 1883, and
was selected to speak to one of the resolutions passed by the
convention. He also attended the Young Liberal Convention of 1885, as a

work for a year and a half. Eleven months of this vacation were devoted
to a visit to Europe, including England, Scotland, Ireland, Belgium, the
Rhine, Switzerland, France and Italy. On Nov. 21, 1877, Mr. Coyne

=Best, John= (Shelburne, Ont.), was born in Australia in 1861, of Irish
parentage. His father, John Best, was a farmer, and his mother was
Elizabeth Rolland. The subject of this sketch received his education in
the public school at Whitfield, in the County of Dufferin, and for many
years has been prominent in the municipal life of his township and
county. For 14 years he was a member of the County Council, and for 7
years President of The Dufferin Fire Insurance Company. In 1909 he was
selected as successor to the late Dr. L. John Barr, M.P., as the
Liberal-Conservative candidate for Dufferin in the House of Commons,
being returned by acclamation in 1911. He was again elected on the
Reciprocity issue by the large majority of 1,459. Elected in 1917 by
over 2,600 majority. Mr. Best has proven a most capable and efficient
representative, being thoroughly well versed in all the problems which
especially concern his constituents. A practical farmer, he takes a
lively interest in everything tending to promote the advancement of the
basic interest industry of agriculture. Realizing the importance and
advantage of the governmental scheme of Rural Mail Delivery, and its
necessity and benefit, he advocated its extension and development in his
own riding, where it has now reached the highest degree of efficiency
and service. He is also a liberal supporter of Agricultural Societies.
Mr. Best is well informed on all matters of National importance, and is
a ready and effective speaker. The inclination and ability for public
service is a family characteristic, for two of Mr. Best’s cousins are in
the Imperial Parliament, Mr. James Best, M.P., and Mr. Thomas Best,
M.P., who represents an Irish constituency. In 1887 Mr. Best married
Charlotte, only daughter of Mr. Thomas Thompson, of Thornbury, and has
one son John Chester. The member for Dufferin is prominent in the Orange
Order, being Past County Master. In religion he is a member of the
Church of England. Recreations: Motoring and fishing.

=Bowell, Sir Mackenzie= (Belleville, Ont.). A name universally known in
Canada is that of the late Hon. Sir Mackenzie Bowell, K.C.M.G.,
ex-Premier of the Dominion and ex-Leader of the Conservative Party in
the Senate. He was born on December 27th, 1823, at Rickinghall, Suffolk,
England, the son of the late John Bowell, a carpenter and builder. He
came to Canada with his parents, ten years later, the family locating at
Belleville, Ont., then Upper Canada, which has ever since remained his
home, and where he was shortly afterwards apprenticed to learn the trade
of a printer in the office of the Belleville “Intelligencer,” a
newspaper of which in after years he became editor and proprietor. As a
young man, Sir Mackenzie became prominent in public affairs. He became
an Ensign in the Belleville Rifle Company, which he assisted in
organizing in 1857, and was one of the corps of observation on service
in Western Ontario during the American Civil War. During the Fenian
Raids of 1866 he was on service at Prescott. In 1874 he retired from the
service with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel of the 49th Battalion. He
also became prominent in the Orange Order and rose to the position of
Grand Master and Sovereign of the Order for British North America and
President of the Tri-annual Council of the Orangemen of the World. He
also took an interest in educational matters and served as Chairman of
the Public and Grammar School Boards, as Vice-President of the
Agricultural and Arts Association of Ontario, and as President of the
Ontario Press Association. A Conservative by conviction, he was a
candidate in North Hastings for the Canadian Assembly, in 1863. He was
defeated. In 1867, he was elected to the House of Commons for the same
constituency and held the seat continuously for twenty-five years, until
his elevation to the Senate in 1892. He was a member of the select
committee of Parliament to inquire into the troubles in the North-West
Territories in 1869-70. When the rebel leader, Louis Riel, was elected
to the House of Commons, shortly afterwards, the subject of this sketch
moved his expulsion as a traitor to the Crown. After the Conservative
victory of 1878, he entered Sir John A. Macdonald’s Cabinet as Minister
of Customs, and held that portfolio for thirteen years. In that capacity
it devolved upon him to carry out the new tariff system known as the
National Policy. On the death of Sir John A. Macdonald, he became
Minister of Militia in Sir John Abbott’s Cabinet, and on the demise of
the latter, Minister of Trade and Commerce in Sir John Thompson’s
Ministry. After the latter’s tragic death at Windsor Castle, England, he
was called on in December, 1894, to form a Cabinet, which he succeeded
in doing, taking the portfolio of President of the Council, and on
January 1, 1895, was made Knight Commander of the Most Distinguished
Order of St. Michael and St. George. When the Manitoba School question
arose, he was a strong advocate of justice to the minority, and after
some differences with his colleagues, he resigned the Premiership on
April 27, 1896. He was succeeded by Sir Charles Tupper, who paid him the
compliment of adopting his policy. In 1893, during his incumbency as
Minister of Trade and Commerce, he went to Australia to promote
inter-Imperial trade and the laying of an all-British Pacific cable
between Canada and that continent. Early in 1896 he went to England to
urge forward the Canadian-Australia or “all-red” cable, now an
accomplished fact, and sat in the third congress on the subject which
met in London, England. In 1896 he resumed the active control of the
“Belleville Intelligencer,” which he had relinquished when he entered
Sir John A. Macdonald’s Cabinet in 1878. In Belleville he was regarded
as the “grand old man,” and no Canadian boasted a wider circle of
friends in the country at large. The amiability of his nature, his large
intellectual capacity and his ability as a public speaker, marked him
for distinction. In religion he was a Methodist, and was married in
December, 1847, to Harriet Louisa, eldest daughter of the late Jacob G.
Moore, of Belleville. His helpmate died in 1884, and he followed her to
the grave in 1918. Of nine children born to them, five survive.

=Langley, James P.= (Toronto), was born in the Provincial Capital on
June 15, 1864, and educated in Toronto, graduating from the Model School
in 1877. Son of Aylmer Langley and Alice (Thornber), his father being a
native of Ireland and his mother born in New York State. The subject of
this sketch early developed a marked ability as an expert accountant and
was one of the early members of the Institute of Chartered Accountants
of Ontario, an institution which has done much to stimulate the study of
higher accounting and to keep pace with the commercial and municipal
necessities of the day, and is a Fellow of the Institute so founded. Mr.
Langley is recognized as a man with a large and intimate knowledge of
industrial and financial enterprises, and his services are in constant

=Chamberlain, Theodore F., M.D.=, only son of Asher A. and Eliza Ann
Chamberlain. Born at Harlem, County of South Leeds, Ontario, July 6,
1838. His family came from Birmingham, England, and were in politics,
Cobdenites. The family crest bears the motto “Sapiens et Fidus.” His
father was born in Vermont, U.S., Feb. 12, 1810, and came to Upper
Canada in 1815, locating in the County of South Leeds. After attending
school at Potsdam, N.Y., he entered the Medical College at Fairfield,
N.Y., after which he returned to Harlem, South Leeds, and began the
practice of medicine, which profession he followed with more than common
success, until his death at Athens, on February 20, 1883. He was Past
Master of Harmony Masonic Lodge, Leeds, one of the oldest, if not the
oldest, Masonic lodge in Upper Canada. He was Major in the Eighth
Battalion, Leeds Militia, was a staunch temperance man, a member of the
Methodist Church, and always took an active part in politics, from the
troublous times of the Rebellion of 1836-7 down to the time of his
death. At the time of the Beverly Election Riots in South Leeds, he
nearly lost his life at the hands of the Tory Party under the leadership
of Ogle R. Gowan’s Orangemen. He was one of the deputation from Upper
Canada who went to the rescue of Lord Elgin at the time of the burning
of the Parliament Buildings in Montreal in 1849. His connection with the
Masonic lodge has already been noticed; this lodge he resuscitated at
Farmersville, in 1859, under the name of “Rising Sun Lodge,” and was for
several years its Master; was a Justice of the Peace, Postmaster at
Harlem, and held other positions of trust. Dr. Chamberlain’s mother was
Eliza Ann Toffey, and was born at Quaker Hill, N.Y., Oct. 15, 1803, and
died at Athens, formerly Farmersville, on March 20, 1894. The
grandparents on both sides lived to very advanced years. The doctor has
one sister, born at Harlem, August 2, 1836, and now living (1913) in
Toronto. She is the widow of the late J. C. Miller, ex-M.P.P. for Parry
Sound and Muskoka District, and owner of the Parry Sound Lumber Co. The
early education of the subject of this sketch was gained from parental
instruction at night around the old home fireside, and at the Township
School. He attended the Grammar School at Perth for some months in 1851,
and then served some two years as clerk in the general mercantile
establishment of Henry Laishley, at Elgin, where he gained the business
training and experience that stood him so well in later life. In 1851 he
served as Lieutenant, under Capt. Wm. J. Smith, and Col. Young, in the
8th Battalion of Leeds Militia. Later he took up the study of dentistry
in the office of F. D. Laughlin, Ottawa. After practising his profession
for some time, he went, in the fall of 1857, to New York City, but
later, yielding to solicitations of his father, he returned to his home
in Athens, to take up medicine. He matriculated at Queen’s College,
Kingston, in 1859, and passed the final examination in March, 1862,
receiving the degree of Doctor of Medicine and Surgery, and his license
to practice in Canada, from the hands of Governor-General Monk. On the
13th of April following, Dr. Chamberlain located at Morrisburg, County
of Dundas, on the St. Lawrence River, and during the succeeding years
built up a large and lucrative practice. In 1859 he was requested by the
government of Sir Oliver Mowat to take the Inspectorship of Public
Institutions of Ontario. The history of the doctor during these years is
the history of a busy life. Besides following his profession, he served
as Reeve of his municipality, member of the Counties’ Council, and
Warden of the United Counties of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry, Justice
of the Peace, Health Officer, member of the High and Public Board of
Education, Director of the Agricultural Association, and Director of the
Parry Sound Lumber Company. Inspector of schools for County of Dundas.
At the time of the Fenian Raid, he was member of a strong company of
volunteers under Captain I. N. Rose, Superintendent of the Williamsburg
Canals, and with other members of the company was out night and day on
guard at the locks, and in the village, as an attack was daily expected
to be made by General O’Neal. On the 1st of July, the General with 1,600
men appeared on the bank of the river opposite Morrisburg. The
Government of Sir John A. Macdonald, realizing the seriousness of the
situation, and desirous of keeping informed of O’Neal’s movements,
appointed a man to keep in touch with O’Neal’s forces, but this man
failing to accept, Dr. Chamberlain, a strong personal, but not a
political, friend of Sir John’s, was detailed for this duty. He accepted
the appointment, and taking his horses and buggy, and accompanied by a
young man named Leslie Weaver, set out to follow the Fenian force, and
to report as fully as possible their movements and designs. Crossing the
river to Waddington, N.Y., on Capt. Murphy’s Ferry, on July 9, he found
that the Fenians had moved, and he followed them to Malone, about 50
miles distant, over-taking them about dark. Staying over night and
having obtained all information possible, he left the next morning for
Plattsburgh, which place he made that evening. After a wearisome and
anxious night, he left Plattsburgh for Whitehall, at the foot of Lake
Champlain, arriving there the next morning, and at Saratoga in the
evening. He continued the journey to Troy and Albany, and returned
thence to Ogdensburg, Prescott, and home to Morrisburg. The result of
this close espionage, and prompt reports by the scouts, and the careful
guarding of the river, was that the invaders were compelled to abandon
their design of crossing the river, and to turn their faces to the west.
The doctor’s services on this occasion were most effective and valuable,
yet he never applied for nor received land grant, or medal, nor refund
of his expenditure. In 1879, the doctor, as Warden, was appointed by the
Counties’ Council, then in session, to go as their representative to the
eastern boundary of the province, to meet their Excellencies, the
Governor-General, the Marquis of Lorne, and the Princess Louise, and
welcome them to Ontario. Later in the year he presented to their
Excellencies at Government House, Ottawa, an address on behalf of the
inhabitants of the United Counties of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry.
The doctor has always been an ardent politician, an indefatigable
worker, and a vigorous but generous opponent. He was the candidate of
the Reform Party for the Legislative Assembly for the county in 1879,
and was defeated by 81 votes. In 1882, he was again the party candidate,
this time for the House of Commons, and again defeated by 79 votes.
Nothing discouraged, he again came before the Electors, in 1886, for the
Assembly, and was elected by 25 majority. He was defeated next election
by 28 votes, and again in 1904, was defeated for the Commons. In
conjunction with his brother-in-law, Mr. W. G. Parish, of Athens, he
established in the seventies, the first three cheese factories in
Eastern Ontario. He carried on an extensive drug business in Morrisburg,
from 1886 to 1873, when he sold it to Messrs. Carman and Brown. In 1871,
he received the degree of L.R.C.P.S. from Queen’s College, Kingston, as
well as that of F.B.S. During his practice in Morrisburg he had as
students, Messrs. Hart, McLean, Howes, Musgrove, Lane, Shibbley,
Beckstead and McKay, all of whom became successful practitioners. He was
always a strong advocate of temperance, and a member of the Methodist
Church. He became a member, under dispensation of the Grand Master, of
Rising Sun Masonic Lodge, Athens, in 1857, and joined Excelsior Lodge,
Morrisburg, No. 142, G.R.C., in 1862, and is yet an honorary life
member, having filled every office in the gift of the lodge, and having
received various decorations and gold medals. In 1867 he became a member
of the Grenville Royal Arch Chapter, No. 23, at Prescott. In 1869-70 he
was elected by the Grand Lodge, District-Deputy Grand Master for St.
Lawrence District. In 1885 he received the 95 degrees in the Supreme
Rite of Memphis, known as the Sovereign Sanctuary Degrees. In 1873 the
doctor explored the country east and north of Lake Superior to the
height of land, examining for timber and minerals. In 1878 he explored
the country along the shores of Georgian Bay, the “Soo,” and to the head
of Lake Nipissing. In 1883 he visited part of the southern, middle and
western States, including California, Colorado, Nevada, Utah, New Mexico
and Mexico. In 1889, leaving Montreal, he travelled through the
North-Western Territories, and Victoria, Vancouver, Puget Sound, and
Washington Territory. From 1889 to 1904, he acted as one of the
Provincial Inspectors of Asylums, Prisons, Gaols and Hospitals, serving
in that capacity until 1904, when he resigned, owing to ill health. In
1906 he was appointed by the Dominion Government, under the Public
Health Department, Inspector of all the doctors employed on Public
Works, from the Red River to the Pacific Ocean. In pursuance of the
duties of this position, he had to travel distances of from 1,000 to
1,500 miles at a trip, ford rivers, make his own trail over prairies,
sleep in a tent wherever night overtook him, in that great lone land. In
the winter of 1907, he sent in his resignation, and in the spring of
1908, inspected and estimated the timber on the Dokis Indian Reserve,
Lake Nipissing. The pine timber on this Reserve was sold by the
Government at Ottawa in June, and the doctor bought one of the limits,
and in the fall had buildings, appliances, and materials complete for
lumbering operations. During the winter he took out, and in the spring
sent, 2,300 pieces of board timber, for the English market, by way of
Lake Nipissing to Callender, thence by rail to Kingston, and rafting it
thence to Quebec. He closed up this deal, and in 1910 went to
California, visiting by the way, the principal cities in the West.
During the past 30 years, he has bought and sold large quantities of
pine timber in Ontario, and prospected for and located mines in the
Rainy River and Lake-of-the-Woods Districts, and explored almost every
part of Northern Ontario mining and timber lands. Dr. Chamberlain
married, in 1862, Annetta, third daughter of Arza Parish, Esq.,
merchant, Athens. He has one son, W. P., born at Morrisburg on May 19,
1863, and one daughter, also born at Morrisburg, March 8, 1871. The Dr.
and Mrs. Chamberlain celebrated their golden wedding on July 3, 1912.
They had resided in Toronto since 1890, but the lure of his profession
became too strong, and so the doctor has improved and embellished his
beautiful residence in Morrisburg, fitted it up with all the latest
devices and scientific appliances, and is conducting most successfully a
Sanatorium for the relief and cure of suffering humanity.

Terrebonne, Quebec, and was educated at Terrebonne College. In 1860 he
went to the United States, and at the outbreak of the Civil War, in
1861, entered the regular army of that country and received in

1866 during the riots in that city, and in 1868 was in command of the
troops at Augusta, Georgia, during the riots which took place between
the whites and the colored people on the occasion of the first election
of President Grant. He retired from the United States Army, January 1,
1871, and September 15, 1873, entered the Civil Service of Canada. He
successively held the appointments of Secretary Department of Public
Works, Sheriff of the North-West Territories, and Clerk of the Crown in
Chancery. On January 27, 1900, he was appointed Clerk of the Senate and
held that position until he retired, in the early part of 1917. In view

branch. Besides his business connections he is an ardent worker in
church circles and a regular attendant of the Timothy Eaton Memorial
Church. He is a member of the Ontario Club, Toronto Bowling Club, Board
of Trade and the Ontario Motor League, taking an active interest in the
good roads campaign of 1910. He is also a director of the Tisdale Iron
Stable Fittings Co. In looking over the extensive buildings erected in
Toronto, one can only imagine the important part Mr. Aikenhead has
played from a business standpoint, and he can truly be classed as one of
the builders of Canada.

=MacDonald, Neil S., B.A., D.Paed.= (Toronto, Ont.), Public School
Inspector, is the son of the late John F. MacDonald and Mrs. MacDonald,
formerly of Darlington, now of Toronto. Born in Bowmanville, Durham
County, Ont., on January 28, 1872, he received his early education in
Clarke Union Public School and Bowmanville High School. At the end of
six months in the latter school, he obtained a Third Class Teacher’s
Certificate, and at the next Departmental Examination he obtained a
Second Class Certificate and spent several years teaching in the rural
schools of the Townships of Cartwright, Darlington and Hope. Feeling
that he had learned all he could in these schools, he returned to
Bowmanville High School to prepare for honor matriculation into Toronto
University, and at his matriculation made a splendid record, receiving
honors in Mathematics, Science, English, History and Geography. He did
not enter the University, however, but took a year’s course in practical
teaching in the Ontario Normal College at Hamilton, after which he was
engaged as Principal in Richmond Hill Public School, where he stayed for
one year, going from there to Toronto to accept the office of
Vice-Principal of Ryerson School, which he held for six years, receiving
while there training in the method of city schools under Principal
McAllister. Then he was promoted to the Principalship of Duke Street
Public School and after three years there was once more promoted, to be
Principal of Cottingham Street Public School. He spent one year here,
when he was promoted to Bolton Avenue School. Mr. MacDonald held a high
ideal of success ever before his mind and backed it up with praiseworthy
perseverance, and he owes his marked success in life to the
stick-to-it-iveness which is one of his special characteristics. In 1910
he graduated from Queen’s University with the degree of B.A., very much
to his credit, for he obtained this degree by private study while
filling the position of Principal in a city school. Mr. MacDonald
married Christina Lamb, the daughter of William Lamb, and has one son,
Donald, born on August 29, 1913. Upon the retirement of Mr. R. W. Doan,
in June, 1914, Mr. MacDonald became Principal of Dufferin School,
Toronto, and it has been said of him, “His educational attainments,
energy and enthusiasm mark him as a man well qualified to fill the
highest position a School Board may offer.” Besides managing the regular
school work, he took an active interest in the school sports and cadet
drill, and his scholars always obtained good standing in these. After
three years as Principal of Dufferin School, Mr. MacDonald was
transferred, in September, 1917, to Ryerson School, as Principal in
succession to the late W. E. Groves. Ryerson School is the school for
practice teaching in connection with the Faculty of Education. As
Principal he was chief critic teacher and supervisor of critic teachers.
In February, 1918, the Toronto Board of Education appointed him Public
School Inspector in District Five, a position left vacant by the death
of Inspector W. F. Chapman, B.A. He is a Presbyterian in religion,
belonging to St. John’s Presbyterian Church, where he is also
Superintendent of the Sabbath School; a Conservative in politics and a
member of St. Andrew’s Masonic Society, St. Patrick’s Royal Arch Masons
and Cyrene Preceptory. In the spring of 1918 the degree of Doctor of
Pedagogy was conferred upon Mr. MacDonald, and in partial fulfilment for
the degree he submitted a thesis on “Open Air Schools,” which he has
recently published.

=Beach, Mahlon F.=, Manufacturer (Iroquois, Ont.), who died January 4,
1917, at the ripe age of more than eighty-three years, was one of the
most remarkable self-made men in Eastern Canada and belonged to a family
which can boast one of the most striking genealogical records in the
Dominion. The family record shows his lineage back to John Beach, one of
three pilgrim brothers who migrated from England to New Haven Colony,
Conn., early in the Seventeenth Century, the two other pilgrim brothers
being Richard and Thomas. Richard first appears in the New Haven Colony
in 1638, and was a man of some note in his day. Thomas first appears in
the records in 1646, and settled in Milford, Connecticut. John is first
mentioned in the New Haven Colony records, January 4, 1643. Four years
later he bought “an house lott” there and in 1650 married Mary ——.
Next we find him at Stratford, Connecticut, where he acquired land in
1660 and was chosen “Town Crier” in the following years, being allowed
fourpence “for everything he should crye and every time he cryed.” He
signed the Articles of Agreement for the Wallingford Plantation in 1670,
and was granted a “house lott” there in 1671. He appears fourth in a
list of six persons of “Hiest Rank,” July 29, 1672, and in 1675 was one
of a committee to establish a Church, dying between the years 1678 and
1680, the ancestor of a large number of Beaches, scattered over United
States, Canada and South America. Mahlon Ford Beach, the subject of this
sketch, was born November 10, 1833, in Oxford Township, Grenville
County, Province of Ontario, where his father, Mahlon Beach, son of
David Beach, arriving from New Jersey, was one of the first settlers.
His Mother, Mercy May, born in New York State, May 12, 1798, was a
daughter of Lyman Clothier, who migrated to the vicinity and built the
first mills in what is now known as the Village of Kemptville. Married
Louise C. Wickmire, of Augusta Township, Grenville County, in 1865, and
leaves a family of ten boys, all of whom are living, born as follows:
Charles A., of Cornwall, 1866; Fred. W., of Morrisburg, 1868; Dr. Anson
W., of Toronto, and Benson C., of Ottawa (twins), 1870; Mahlon W., of
Kingston, 1872; Howard B., of Iroquois, 1873; D. Easton, of Ottawa, and
G. Weston, of Winchester (twins), 1875; J. Russell, of Ottawa, 1878; and
Olin A., of Ottawa, 1882. One daughter, born in 1877, died in infancy.
Mrs. Beach died in 1907, aged seventy-one years and eleven months, and
Mr. Beach married Mrs. Hannah M. Barber, of Winnipeg, in 1912, by whom
he is survived. Although controlling probably a quarter of a million
dollars at his death, Mr. Beach started life like thousands of other
poor boys, with only his native industry, wit and enterprise to raise
him above his restricted circumstances and give his talents a larger
field of activity. He was a born captain of industry and remarkable in
many ways, exciting a big influence not only in his community, but
throughout the county. Possessed of a strong personality, an untiring
energy, quick perception and bold and fearless in his business
enterprises, he left his stamp on the community in which he lived and
his name will always be connected with the village and township of
Winchester. This place was hardly a settlement when Mr. Beach first came
there, and when he erected his first mill it was the beginning of a new
life in the community, as previously the nearest mill was at Iroquois.
He was educated at the common schools of his native place and set out to
carve his own fortune early in life. He first worked at the millwright
business, and in 1856 went to the Township of Winchester, Dundas County,
where he built a small saw mill, later adding other machinery and
buildings, such as planing mills, sash and door, and flour mills. During
the years 1861-1864 he engaged in square timber operations, taking the
timber to Quebec. In the spring of 1883 he bought a water privilege on
the St. Lawrence Canal, at Iroquois, and moved there in June of the same
year, where he commenced a roller flour mill, which was put in operation
in the fall of 1884. At Mr. Beach’s place in Winchester, where the old
business is still continued, he saw grow up what is now a flourishing
village. Between the years 1861-1878 Mr. Beach was connected directly
and indirectly with the general store business and has always been
successful in his undertakings. In 1884 his mills at Winchester were
destroyed by fire, and a number of other valuable buildings, also a
quantity of sawn lumber, flour and wheat to the amount of about $75,000,
were all swept away without any insurance to cover the loss. This
naturally crippled him financially, but nothing daunted, he commenced
again, rebuilding the mills in a much better manner than before and
adding a furniture factory to them, thus showing that the spirit of the
man was bigger than any adversity and that he did not know the meaning
of failure. He met every obstacle with indomitable faith in himself as
the biggest asset of human enterprise, which, more than any other, was a
characteristic of Mr. Beach. He had absolute faith in his own judgment
and with great capacity and resource he soon recovered his losses. He
was President of the Beach Foundry Co., Ltd., of Ottawa, and also with
his son Charles A., established the Beach Furniture Factory, at
Cornwall. In 1909 he completed a water power development in Iroquois,
one of the latest and most improved hydro-electric power plants in
America. In order to carry out this undertaking, he was obliged to
resort to the European markets for the electrical apparatus. The
generators came from Sweden, where they were designed and made
especially for the conditions met with in development. It might truly be
said that this was the pioneer plant in Canada for the vertical type,
direct connected to wheel, operating under a low head of water. This
fact was attested to by many eminent engineers from all over the
American continent, who inspected the plant after its completion. In
1910, with his two sons, Benson C. and Charles A., he was interested in
the development of a 4,000 h.p. Hydro-Electric Power Plant at Hound
Chute, on the Montreal River, furnishing the first electrical energy
used in the Cobalt District. Associated with the late Hon. Andrew
Broder, M.P., he secured in 1882, a charter for the Montreal and Central
Canada Railroad. With the charter they interviewed Sir Wm. Van Horne, of
the C.P.R. Asked what they wanted for their charter and expense of
promoting, the reply was “We want a railroad.” The C.P.R. took over the
charter, the line was built and now forms part of the main line between
Toronto and Montreal. Mr. Beach was one of the foremost men interested
in the erection of the present magnificent Methodist Church at
Winchester. His public career has been confined to municipal affairs. He
was warden of the United Counties of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry for
the year 1873. In politics he was a Liberal, and in religion a
broad-minded adherent of the Methodist Church, and opposed to
ostentation. Even passing his eighty-third birthday, Mr. Beach exhibited
remarkable vitality of mind and body, being still actively engaged in
his several interests, but on January 4, 1917, he suddenly passed away,
the direct cause being due to acute congestion of the kidneys,
complicated with pneumonia. His useful and successful life will long be
remembered with respect.

=Macdonald, John= (Toronto, Ont.), the present head of the great
wholesale dry goods firm of John Macdonald & Co., of Toronto, is still a
young man. He bears the name of his father, the founder of the business,
and was born on the 4th of November, 1863, at the old family homestead,
Oaklands, a beautiful villa on the hills overlooking the city of
Toronto. He was educated at Upper Canada College, which boasts the names
of a very large number of distinguished families on its rolls, and while
still a lad entered (1880) the great dry goods establishment which then
bore his father’s name and was founded by him in 1849. Under his
distinguished father’s guidance he received a sound business training,
and was thus, on the death of the latter, able to undertake the great
responsibility devolving upon him. The firm was made a Joint Stock
Company, of which he was appointed President in 1906. He is a Director
of the following: Bank of Toronto, Confederation Life Association,
Toronto Hotel Co., Ltd., Guarantee Company of North America, Millers and
Manufacturers Insurance Co., Humane Society, Hospital for Incurables,
Academy of Music. Honorary Governor Toronto General Hospital; member
Toronto Board of Trade; Chairman Bureau Municipal Research; Trustee and
Official, Yonge St. Methodist Church; Vice-Chairman, Financial
Committee; member Defence League. The late Hon. John Macdonald sat in
the Senate of Canada for several years, and was a most distinguished
figure in religious and philanthropic work. The subject of this sketch
is a man of varied interests and wide social popularity, while retaining
the sound business energy characteristic of his family. In the affairs
of his alma mater, Upper Canada College, he has taken a deep interest,
and was one of those public-spirited graduates who took an active part
in the work of reorganization which a few years ago put it on a sound
basis and largely increased its usefulness. He is also a member of the
Methodist Communion, in which his father was so long an eminent figure,
and has interested himself in the affairs of Yonge Street Methodist
Church, of which he is a Trustee. He holds the office of Justice of the
Peace, but fortunately is not compelled to frequently exercise his
function as a magistrate. Among the commercial organizations with which
he is identified, may be mentioned the Toronto Board of Trade, in which
he is prominent in the dry goods section. His is also one of the
best-known names on the roll of the Commercial Travellers’ Association,
one of the most powerful organizations in Canada. He is also a member of
the British Empire League, the object of which is to further the
progress of an enlightened Imperialism in Canada; of the well-known
benevolent society, the Ancient Order of United Workmen; of the
Caledonian Society, to which he belongs by virtue of his Scottish
descent; and is a member, also, by virtue of the family traditions, of
the York pioneers; a member also of the Methodist Union College Heights
Association, Upper Canada College Old Boys’ Association, St. Andrew’s
Society, and the Canadian Institute. Clubs: York, National, British
Empire. Like all men of active mind, Mr. Macdonald has a hobby, and in
his case the hobby is horseflesh. His beautiful home at Oaklands always
boasts some fine animals in its stables, and he has earnestly devoted
himself to the improvement of Canadian stock. He was one of the original
promoters and is a Director of the Annual Horse Show at Toronto, and is
also an active member of the Horse Breeders’ Association, and of the
Hackney Horse Association. It will thus be seen that Mr. Macdonald is a
man of catholic tastes and wide energies. He resides at 116 Farnham
Avenue, Toronto.

=Longley, Hon. J. W.= (Halifax, N.S.), Judge of the Supreme Court of
Nova Scotia. One of the best-known men in Canadian public life, and a
gentleman who combines literary graces with a practical public spirit,
is Hon. James Wilberforce Longley, late Attorney-General and
Commissioner of Crown Lands for the Province of Nova Scotia. Hon. Mr.
Longley was born at Paradise, Annapolis County, Nova Scotia, on January
4, 1849, the son of Israel Longley and Frances Manning. Like so many
noted Nova Scotians, he is a descendant of an old New England family,
and his grandfather, William Longley, came to Nova Scotia from
Massachusetts in 1760, and settled at Belleisle, in Annapolis County.
The subject of this sketch attended school first at Paradise and later
received his education in the higher branches at Acadia University,
Wolfville, N.S., where he received the B.A. degree in 1871; M.A., 1875;
D.C.L., 1897; Hon. LL.D. St. Francis Xavier College, Antigonish, N.S.,
1905. He began the study of law in the office of Hiram Blanchard, K.C.,
of Halifax, and completed his course with the legal firm of Johnston &
Bligh; read law with Bethune & Hoyles, Toronto, and W. A. Johnson,
Halifax, N.S.; he also attended for a term at Osgoode Hall, Toronto, and
was called to the Nova Scotia Bar at Halifax in 1875, where he
immediately began the practice of his profession; two years as Bligh &
Longley; four years with Mr. Motton, and as McCoy & Longley. He quickly
made a reputation by his ability, and in 1883 was appointed by the
Provincial Government as one of the commission for the revision and
consolidation of the Statutes. Journalism had always attracted Mr.
Longley, and while a law student he had become identified with the
“Acadian Recorder,” of Halifax, as its chief editorial writer.
Subsequently he joined the staff of the “Halifax Morning Chronicle,” and
for some time filled the responsible post of managing editor. Mr.
Longley’s literary and clear attractive style has borne fruit in
contributions to many of the leading reviews and periodicals of England
and the United States. In 1898, “Love,” a religious and philosophical
essay appeared in book form and has passed through several editions. He
has also written “Socialism, Its Truths and Errors”; “The Greatest
Drama”; “A Material Age”; “Canada and Imperial Federation”; “Religion in
the 19th Century”; “Makers of Canada” (Series); “The Political History
of Canada” (four volumes complete); “Life of Joseph Howe,” and “Life of
Sir Charles Tupper.” He was President of the Nova Scotia Historical
Society and a member of the Royal Society of Canada. Coincident with his
legal and literary activities, Hon. Mr. Longley has taken an active part
in politics. He was for some years President of the Young Men’s Liberal
Club of Halifax, and entered public life in 1882 as member of the Nova
Scotia Legislature for Annapolis County, which constituency he
represented until 1905. Two years later Hon. W. S. Fielding, in forming
his Government, invited Mr. Longley to enter it, and in July, 1884, he
was sworn in as a Minister without Portfolio. In 1886 he was appointed
Attorney-General. In 1896 he resigned to enter a contest for Federal
honors in the House of Commons. Being defeated, his old constituents in
Annapolis at once re-elected him by acclamation. At the request of the
Premier, Hon. Mr. Murray, he resumed the duties of Attorney General for
Nova Scotia, which position he held for over nineteen years. In his
public capacity, he was a member of the famous inter-Provincial
Conference at Quebec in 1887, and was one of the prominent figures in
the historic convention of the Reform Party in 1893, when the platform
of the then Opposition was struck. As a legislator he has initiated many
useful provincial measures, embracing important changes in the criminal
procedure, the abolition of imprisonment for debt, consolidation of
County Court Procedure and the incorporation of towns. He is a director
of the British Empire Financial Corporation, and is a great social
favorite in most of the cities of Canada. Has been a Fellow of the Royal
Society of Canada and was elected Honorary President. On September 4,
1877, he married Annie Brown, daughter of Mr. Newton Brown (deceased,
October, 1899); secondly, Lois Fletcher, daughter of George Fletcher,
Yorkshire, Eng., April, 1901, and has five sons and one daughter. He is
a member of the Halifax and Saraquay Clubs; a director of the Home Life
Association, and received his present appointment in 1905; also a member
of A.F. & A.M. He was created K.C. by Lord Stanley (afterwards Earl of
Derby) in 1890.

=Massey, C. D.= (Toronto, Ont.). The name of Massey is known throughout
the length and breadth of Canada, not only on account of the vastness of
the business interests associated with that name, but because of the
great philanthropies with which it is also synonymous. As the surviving
head of the family that has built up Canada’s greatest individual
industrial enterprise, the figure of Mr. Chester Daniel Massey, the
subject of this sketch, is doubly fraught with interest. He is the son
of the late Hart A. Massey, who was the son and successor in business of
Daniel Massey, the founder of the great establishment for the
manufacture of agricultural implements now known as the Massey-Harris
Company, Limited, and has been associated with that business, of which
he is now the Honorary President, since boyhood. Both the brothers who
had also been identified with the growth and management of the
enterprise, Charles A. Massey and Walter E. H. Massey, have also passed
away. But Mr. Chester D. Massey is splendidly carrying out the
traditions of the family. He was born on June 17, 1850, in Haldimand
Township, in the County of Northumberland, Ontario, and received his
education at the Public Schools of the province. While still a boy he
entered the business establishment of his father, then centred at
Newcastle, Ontario. Literally speaking, he has grown up with the
business, which in turn has grown up with the country (coincident with
the vast expansion of agricultural enterprise in Canada). In 1879 the
headquarters of the Massey firm were removed to Toronto, where Mr.
Massey has resided since the year 1882. In 1884 his eldest brother,
Charles A. Massey, died, and the duties devolving on him became the
heavier. The period that has elapsed since then has been one of immense
expansion, which the firm attained by a judicious policy of amalgamation
and by extending its agencies not only from the Atlantic to the Pacific,
but beyond the seven seas in all the corners of the earth. As has been
intimated, commercial interests do not by any means absorb the entire
attention of Mr. Massey. He is largely interested in all religious and
philanthropic movements. He is a member of the Methodist Church, to
which he is greatly attached, and his voice is at all times valued in
its councils. He is a Governor of the University of Toronto; a Regent of
Victoria University, and a Trustee of the Metropolitan Church and the
Methodist Deaconess Home and Training School, all of Toronto. He is also
a Trustee of Massey Music Hall, one of the finest buildings that
unselfish citizenship ever gave to a community. As chief executor of his
father’s estate, he necessarily takes a deep interest in the valuable
works of philanthropy which have been carried out under the provisions
of the will. On March 17, 1886, Mr. Massey was married at Erie, Pa., to
Miss Anna D. Vincent (deceased, London, England, November 11, 1903), and
secondly to Miss Margaret Phelps, of Gloversville, N.Y., Jan. 3, 1907;
has two sons by first wife, Charles Vincent and Raymond Hart Massey.

=White, Arthur V.=, Consulting Engineer, Toronto, Ontario, was born in
Woodstock, Ontario, August 21, 1871. His father was the late James
White, Esq., a prominent merchant, well known throughout South-western
Ontario, and for more than twenty-five years Clerk of the County of
Oxford, in which office he succeeded his father, who was one of the
early Scotch pioneers of Woodstock. His mother was Dorothy Jessie
McLeod, eldest daughter of W. C. McLeod, Esq., one of the most
widely-known merchants and financiers of pioneer days in Ontario. Mr.
White’s early education was carried on in the Woodstock Public and High
Schools, after which he entered the University of Toronto, where he
graduated from the School of Practical Science with high standing in
1892. He later obtained from the University of Toronto the degree of
M.E. (mechanical engineer), being the first graduate of that institution
to receive this degree. After graduating, Mr. White followed his
profession in connection with manufacturing establishments in Canada and
the United States, and for some years was Chief Draughtsman for the
Canadian General Electric Company, at Peterboro. Subsequently, he was
Lecturer in Mechanical Drawing and Machine Design at the Toronto
Technical School. He spent about five years in London, England, as
engineering expert to Messrs. Brown Brothers, for whom he executed
important commissions on the Continent, as well as in the United States,
travelling extensively in connection therewith. August 28, 1901, Mr.
White married Aidine Squire, eldest daughter of Hon. Watson C. Squire,
LL.D., of Seattle, Wash., ex-United States Senator from that State, and
formerly Governor of Washington Territory, and Ida Remington, eldest
daughter of Philo Remington, Esq., the noted manufacturer of firearms.
Mr. White has three children—James Arthur, Remington, and Caroline
Lathrop. Returning to take up his residence in Canada in 1902, Mr. White
continued his professional work. In 1905, representing the noted
engineers, Messrs. Ross & Holgate, Mr. White personally canvassed
leading manufacturers in South-western Ontario respecting power
requirements and collected much of the field data basic to the
recommendations of the Ontario Power Commission, the precursor of the
present Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario. Later he worked
chiefly upon constructional engineering and devoted considerable time to
designing in connection with Harbor Works for the Department of Public
Works, Canada. In 1910, he was engaged by the Commission of
Conservation, Ottawa, with which he still remains as Consulting
Engineer. He has reported for this Commission upon the Water Powers of
the Provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Ontario and British
Columbia; also upon the St. Lawrence Long Sault Rapids, the Chicago
Drainage Canal, Niagara Power and other matters. In 1911, he was
appointed Consulting Engineer representing Canada to the International
Joint Commission, under the Boundary Waters Treaty, to report jointly
with the consulting engineer from the United States upon the official
reference relating to the levels of the Lake of the Woods, including the
control and utilization of its waters and those tributary thereto. The
Report upon this subject was completed in 1917 and is a comprehensive
work to which the engineering press has referred as reflecting great
credit on its authors. Mr. White has written extensively upon
engineering subjects, but his principal efforts have been devoted to his
various reports for the Federal Government. He is regarded as a high
authority on many questions connected with International waters, and has
made a special study of Niagara power and the exportation of electric
energy with its relationship to coal supply. To the important subject of
Canada’s fuel problem, Mr. White has, for many years, devoted special
attention. Since as early as 1910, he has contributed valuable articles
to such periodicals as the “University Magazine,” the “Monetary Times,”
and prominent engineering and technical journals, as well as to the
daily press, urging that this subject be viewed and dealt with in its
broad national aspect, and that Canada take immediate steps to secure
the greatest possible independence with respect to her fuel supply. Mr.
White possesses a very comprehensive collection of rare books dealing
with the early History of Astronomy. He is opposed to the views of
modern _theoretical_ astronomy as represented by the Copernican System,
and an article from his pen in the University Monthly, in 1909, entitled
“The Shape of the Earth,” has excited considerable comment. In religion
Mr. White is a Protestant. He is non-sectarian, but of strong Christian
belief and is a staunch supporter of the Scriptures. In politics, as in
religion, he is independent.

=Beaumont, Ernest Joseph= (Kitchener, Ont.), Local Registrar of the
Supreme Court, is the son of Joseph Wilson Beaumont, D.D., and Louisa
Beaumont. He was born at Mirfield, Yorkshire, England, February 28,
1855, and received his early education at “The Grammar School,”
Sheffield, Eng. Coming to Canada as a young man, Mr. Beaumont practised
law in Galt, Ont., for twenty-seven years, and served as Town Solicitor
of that place for eighteen years. He was also a member of the Public
School Board for 4 years, and late Major of the 29th Waterloo Battalion,
retiring with rank in 1888. He received his present appointment as local

=Mackintosh, Charles Herbert= (Ottawa, Ont.), was born in London,
Ontario, in 1843; a son of the late Captain William Mackintosh, county
engineer of Middlesex, Ontario, and Leonora Sophia, daughter of Colonel
Dickenson of Jamaica, West Indies. Captain Mackintosh came to Canada as
an attaché of the ordnance branch of the British Army. Mr. Mackintosh
has led an unusually active life, succeeding in making his way, unaided,
to positions of honor and influence. He was educated at the Galt Grammar
School (Tassie’s), and Caradoc Academy (Middlesex Co.), two well-known
institutions at that time. When the Prince of Wales (afterwards King
Edward VII) visited Canada in 1860, an ode of welcome from the pen of
Mr. Mackintosh, then a youth of seventeen, was presented to His Royal
Highness. Two years later, under the title of “Fat Contributor,” he
wrote for the London “Free Press,” a series of articles,
characteristically entitled “Hurry-Graphs.” These attracted wide
attention, and the entrance of the young writer into journalism was a
foregone conclusion. He relinquished the study of law, and became,
first, reporter, and soon afterwards city editor of the “Free Press.”
Believing that the early history of pioneer life in Upper Canada should
be heard from the lips of those who had passed through the ordeal, Mr.
Mackintosh organized a Committee, the result being a Pioneer Banquet, at
which 400 old settlers from local and distant points were in attendance.
Col. J. B. Askin, one of the early pioneers acted as chairman, Mr.
Mackintosh, as the youngest Canadian, acting as Secretary. Subsequent to
this, he assisted in promoting the Western Fair, which to-day has
expanded to noticeable proportions. His journalistic career was marked
by rapid progress. In 1864 he was city editor of the Hamilton “Times.” A
year later he founded the “Dispatch,” of Strathroy, which he conducted
until 1873. In 1868 he married Gertrude Cooke, daughter of T. Cooke,
J.P., of Strathroy. In 1871 he founded the Parkhill “Gazette,” which he
controlled for some time, while still managing the “Dispatch.” In the
same year, he unsuccessfully contested North Middlesex as Conservative
candidate for the local legislature. In 1871 he visited Chicago during
the fire, and wrote a description of the terrible event; 60,000 copies
being sold in two weeks. He was also elected a member of the town
council of Strathroy, in which capacity he exhibited talents, which
afterwards showed to better advantage in a wider sphere. Believing in
himself, as all men do who come to the front in human affairs, he
proceeded to prepare for a higher sphere in public life which he was
destined to fill. Deciding that the protection system which had long
been established in the United States, deserved consideration in Canada,
he accepted the position of managing editor of the Chicago “Journal of
Commerce.” While resident in the western metropolis, he studied
carefully the protection system, as well as other issues in the United
States. He also wrote a graphic account of the United States’ “panic of
1873.” Returning to Canada, at the request of Sir John A. Macdonald the
day after his government was defeated in 1873, he declined an editorial
position on the “Mail”; sold out his interest in the Strathroy
“Dispatch,” and went to Ottawa, being appointed editor of the Ottawa
“Citizen,” the Conservative journal of the capital. He at once attracted
attention, not only because of the vigorous management and writing of
the “Citizen,” but because of knowledge of public questions. At the
celebration of the O’Connell Centennial, he wrote a poem which won the
gold and silver medal over many others submitted. He was an ardent
protectionist long before the Conservative party accepted that system as
a plank in their platform, and must be counted as one of the leaders in
that economic movement. In 1877, the late John Riordon, of St.
Catharines, urged Mr. Mackintosh to co-operate with him in reorganizing
the “Mail,” but the offer was again declined. His active interest in
public affairs, combined with an unusual share of those qualities which
make men popular with their fellows, caused him to be nominated for the
Mayoralty of Ottawa in 1879, the result of the election being his return
by a large majority. He promoted the first Dominion Exhibition, which
was opened by the then Governor-General, Lord Lorne—afterwards Duke of
Argyle. In the two succeeding years he was re-elected, and though
unseated on a technicality after the third contest, was a fourth time
favored with the support of the people. As Mayor of the Capital of
Canada, he inaugurated many reforms, which proved of great benefit to
the city. When retiring from the Mayoralty, the city presented him with
an address; also, citizens generally passed resolutions and presented an
illuminated address. In the General Election of 1882 he was one of the
Conservative candidates in Ottawa for the House of Commons, and was
elected senior member by a sweeping majority. During his term in
Parliament, he made several speeches which were notable for keen common
sense. He spoke but seldom; when he did he always secured an attentive
hearing. He became President of the Ottawa and Gatineau Valley Railroad,
now a part of the Canadian Pacific, and was also a Director of the
Canada Atlantic Railroad, now a part of the Grand Trunk System. Mr.
Mackintosh resigned his seat for Ottawa in July, 1886, but at the
request of friends agreed to hold it until the dissolution, which he
did. The Capital of Canada is no bed of roses for any active or generous
man, and thus the senior member found it, hence his positive objection
to being again a candidate at that time. In the General Election of
1887, Mr. Mackintosh, by the unanimous wish of the Conservative party,
contested Russell against Mr. W. C. Edwards, the largest lumber
manufacturer, and most popular Liberal in the County, and was defeated
by a narrow majority, owing mainly to the feeling against the Government
among the French-Canadians, aroused by the execution of Riel. He polled
2,146 votes, or between 400 and 500 more than were ever given to a
Conservative candidate in that county. The Home Rule and Riel cries
concentrated at least 1,600 votes solidly against any Conservative
nominee, the Constituency being largely Catholic. It should be said,
however, that Mr. Mackintosh was an ardent advocate of and believer in
Ireland’s right to control her own local affairs. But he had voted in
favor of Orange incorporation, publicly declaring that such would, in
the end, ameliorate the bitterness between Protestants and Catholics.
Mr. Edwards upon a protest was unseated for Russell, and a score of his
supporters reported for corruption. The Conservative party let the
matter drop; another election took place with the same result, Mr.
Edwards (now Senator) being returned. In 1888 Mr. Mackintosh declined to
accept nomination for the Mayoralty, and also to be a candidate for the
County of Carleton. In 1890, upon the death of the sitting member, Mr.
Perley, a requisition was presented, signed by prominent Liberals and
Conservatives, asking Mr. Mackintosh to be a candidate. There were four
candidates in the field, but he was elected by over 1,000 majority, and
was again returned at the General Election of 1891. During this time he
became interested in the “Lake Manitoba Railway and Canal Company,”
which subsequently was merged with the Canadian Northern
Transcontinental Line. His leader, Sir John A. Macdonald, died in June,
1891, and until Sir John Thompson became Premier, Mr. Mackintosh took
little interest in political affairs, disposing of his newspaper the
Ottawa “Citizen.” In October, 1893, he was appointed Lieutenant-Governor
of the Canadian North-West Territories, then including the Yukon. Before
leaving Ottawa he was presented with a testimonial and address by the
workingmen of Ottawa, the Conservative Association, and a dinner
tendered by the members of the Rideau Club, at which Judges of the
Supreme Court, Sir John Thompson and other Ministers were present.
During his term, he organized a Dominion Territorial Exhibition in 1895,
spoken of as inaugurating a very beneficial settlement in the
North-West. Prize competition entries reached nearly 8,000 in the
various departments. It was opened by Lord Aberdeen, then
Governor-General. On this occasion the city of Regina presented him with
an oil painting of himself and a complimentary address. In January,
1898, Mr. Mackintosh resigned his high position, going to British
Columbia, successfully organizing the British America Mining
Corporation, of which he was Managing Director, until he resigned, about
1900. In 1902, when King George V (then Duke of York) visited Canada,
Mr. Mackintosh, upon behalf of the Miners of British Columbia, presented
him with unique gold specimens extracted from the western mines. Mr.
Mackintosh remained in the western province for several years, engaging
in literary work. In 1908 he was awarded the 1st prize for an essay on
“British Columbia—Its Resources.” He was for some time in Toronto,
where (in 1910) he wrote a series of articles for the “Mail and Empire,”
forecasting Germany as the storm centre of a coming war. In 1911, when
the Reciprocity issue was before the electors, he wrote a series of
articles against the proposition, visiting nearly every constituency in
Ontario, publishing a signed telegram in the “Montreal Star,” the day
before the election, forecasting the defeat of the Laurier Government
and allowing them not more than fourteen seats in Ontario. When his
party returned to power, he accepted a position as Inspector of Customs,
and has also written many articles on the European War, which broke out
in August, 1914. In May, 1917, a pamphlet written by Mr. Mackintosh,
dealing with the Home Rule issue and entitled “Are Ireland’s Problems on
the Eve of Solution?” attracted much attention, being quoted from at the
Irish Conference by several delegates. Mr. Mackintosh spends much of his
time in British Columbia where he is Chairman of the Halcyon Springs
Company, and is greatly interested in the development of that province’s
mining resources.

=Meek, Edward= (Toronto, Ont.), Barrister, was born in the village of
Port Stanley, Ontario, on December 27, 1844. His father, James Meek,
came to Canada at the early age of three years with his parents, in
1818, from Ballymena, North of Ireland. They settled in the same year in
Talbot District, and took up a tract of land near Port Stanley, being
among the earliest pioneers of that part of the country. At the time of
Edward’s birth his father was a carpenter and builder, but afterwards
became a partner in a foundry which was carried on successfully for a
number of years; but a disastrous fire destroyed the whole of the
extensive establishment, and he returned to his farm, on which he
remained till his death. Edward received his early education at the Port
Stanley school, and afterwards at the Grammar School, St. Thomas. After
leaving school, at the age of seventeen, he was granted a certificate to
teach, which occupation he followed for three years. He then accepted a
position as bookkeeper in a grain warehouse, at which he continued for a
short time only; but thinking a short journey among strangers would
improve his prospects, he went to Boston and engaged with a publishing
house of a prominent firm there. After a short sojourn he returned to
London, Ontario, and there commenced the study of law. In 1873 he
removed to Toronto, where he continued his studies and finished his law
course in the office of Harrison, Osler and Moss, three gentlemen who
afterwards became distinguished judges. He was called to the Bar of
Ontario in the spring of 1874, and he then formed a partnership with the
Hon. John O’Donohoe, which continued for four years, when it was
dissolved. He then opened an office of his own until he formed a
partnership with the late William Norris, of Woodstock, which lasted
till Mr. Norris returned to Woodstock. In 1877 he commenced to take an
active part in the politics of the country, and especially in the
promotion of the National Policy; in fact, he was one of the originators
of the word, and travelled over Ontario assisting in the formation of
political organizations to enable the National Policy party to carry
their new platform to a successful issue. He continued from that time to
take an active part as one of the political writers and speakers on the
platform until the winter of 1884, when he and a number of other
politicians conceived the idea of forming a coalition government for the
Province of Ontario, their object being to do away with partyism in the
local legislature. Others were brought into the scheme who were
impatient of the slow method of bringing about the change by argument,
and thought that a sufficient number of the members of the Legislature
could be secured by offers and promises to at once defeat the Mowat
Government, when the coalition could be immediately formed during the
spring session of 1884. The plans were disapproved of by the originators
of the idea, but the hot heads could not be kept under control, and the
public know the result of the unfortunate conspiracy case which sprung
from it, involving those more actively concerned in the long and tedious
investigation and prosecution before a Royal Commission and in the
criminal courts. The Royal Commission brought in a divided report, which
the House never acted upon. The verdict of the jury in the criminal
court, in the trial of May, 1885, acquitted the accused. Since that time
Mr. Meek has devoted himself strictly to the practice of his profession
in Toronto, and the promotion and formation of joint stock and other
companies. Mr. Meek was joined in marriage, on June 30, 1873, to Anna
Margaret McBride, daughter of Samuel McBride, of London, Ontario, by
which union they have issue two sons and one daughter. Mr. Meek and
family are members of the Church of England. Since the publication of
the preceding matter in the second edition of “Representative
Canadians,” about thirty years ago, Mr. Meek has continued to practise
law in all its branches in the city of Toronto, and is considered a
well-read lawyer, a sound legal adviser, and a successful practitioner.
While carrying on his legal practice, during the past twenty-five years,
he has written many thousands of “Legal Opinions,” published weekly in
the Saturday edition of the “Mail & Empire” newspaper. These concise and
clearly expressed statements of the law have been widely read, and
highly appreciated by many thousands of readers of that journal, and
have been copied in other newspapers. Mr. Meek has also written and
published pamphlets; and essays on Legal and Constitutional questions in
reviews and magazines which have been favorably criticized and commented
upon—notably two essays comparing our Canadian System of Federalism
with the American System of Federalism, entitled, “Some Observations on
the Constitution of the Dominion of Canada,” published in the American
Law Review of 1895, 1896; “The Legal and Constitutional Aspects of the
Manitoba School Questions,” published in the “Canadian Magazine” and in
pamphlet form in 1895; “Political Lessons from the Time of Cicero,”
“Representative Government and Federalism,” the “Plebiscite”—an answer
to an Essay published by the late Sir Geo. W. Ross—and other Essays,
all to be found in the “Canadian Magazine” between 1898 and 1904;
“Sunday Laws,” published in the “Canadian Law Review” in 1904; “The
Mistakes made by the Framers of the Constitution of the United States of
America,” and “Government and Political and Municipal Corporations,”
etc., published later. In 1913 Mr. Meek published a book of 600 pages,
entitled, “Business and Law,” which has had a wide circulation. Mr. Meek
was created a Q.C. in 1896, but for political reasons the patent was
never issued. He was, however, made a K.C. by the Ontario Government in
1908. He has recently published a few short poems which have been much
admired. Now 72, he is in robust health, and his writings are as clear
and concise, and his forensic abilities as convincing as 30 years ago,
with the added copiousness and accuracy acquired by long years of
experience. His eldest son, Mr. Charles S. Meek, is managing director of
the British Pacific Engineering & Construction Company, of Vancouver,
where he resides with his family, consisting of a wife and two
daughters. His second son, Mr. E. J. Meek, is the chief accountant of
the Canadian Bank of Commerce, and resides in Toronto with wife and two

operation. This railway was later purchased by the Delaware & Hudson
Railway Co., the present owners. To-day the Gas and Electric Company

many graduates of the Ontario “little red school-house” who have
achieved success in their chosen professions is Dr. James Thomas Milton
Anderson, M.A., LL.B., of Yorkton, Saskatchewan. Dr. Anderson, who has
won many scholastic honors, is at present inspector of schools for the
Yorkton district. Dr. Anderson was born at Fairbank, Ontario, July 23,
1878. His parents were Mary and James Anderson and the present inspector
of schools had all the advantages of early life on a farm. One must
consider it an advantage when one remembers the sons of farmers who have
gone to the top in scholastic circles. The subject of this sketch began
his education at Public School, S.S. No. 15, York, and went from there
to West Toronto Collegiate Institute. Going west he won his degree of
Bachelor of Arts at the University of Manitoba in 1911, when he was
Silver Medallist in Classics. He gained his LL.B. at the same university
in 1913, and his M.A. in 1914, completing his preparation for his
present work by graduating as Doctor of Pedagogy in 1917. Dr. Anderson
showed rare power of concentration in study as these three degrees were
obtained extra-murally and he is also a medallist in penmanship and a
clever cartoonist. His life for the last ten years has been devoted to
teaching and working among the foreigners who have come to Canada’s
great “melting pot.” Dr. Anderson is intensely interested in the work of
assimilation which means so much to Canada’s future as a nation. He has
published a number of articles on the subject and a book on the
“Education of the New-Canadian” (J. M. Dent & Sons, Toronto). Dr.
Anderson, whose mother resides in Saltcoats, Sask., was married on July
26, 1911, to Edith, daughter of Mrs. M. Redgwick, Grenfell,
Saskatchewan, and has two children: Byron R., born October 10, 1913, and
Edith Elaine, born March 31, 1917. In religion he is an Anglican, a
member of the Orange Order, and President of the School Inspectors’
Association of Saskatchewan.

Middlesex County, on July 25, 1872; educated at Ekfrid Public School,
Glencoe High School, and Trinity University, B.C.L. 1898, and Toronto
University, D.C.L. 1905. Mr. Elliott’s early days were spent on the farm

=Bronson, Hon. Erskine Henry=, was born at Bolton, Warren County, New
York, September 12, 1844. He is the son of the late Henry Franklin and
Edith (Pierce) Bronson, the one man who, coming to Ottawa, Canada, in
1852, understood the feasibility of converting the large lakes and
furious and foaming falls of the Ottawa River into a channel for the
driving of saw-logs, and erecting mills on its banks, placed in
operation a lumber industry that soon had in its employ hundreds, and
afterwards thousands of employees. Having received a good education at
Sandy Hill, N.Y., and at the Grammar School, Ottawa, when quite a youth,
the Hon. Erskine Henry Bronson, joined his father’s company, The
Bronson-Weston Lumber Company, and in 1867 acquired an interest in the
company. In 1870 he became a member of the Ottawa City Council and
chairman of the Finance Committee, and continued as such until 1878,
when he retired. For fourteen years he was a member of the Ottawa School
Board. He is ex-Trustee of Queen’s University, Kingston, Ontario. Unlike
his father, who never interested himself in politics, in 1882 Mr.
Bronson was an unsuccessful candidate to the House of Commons for
Carleton County, Ontario; but in 1886, having had presented to him a
petition signed by thousands of the best and most influential residents
in the Capital urgently soliciting him to become a candidate for the
local Legislature, he consented to run and was elected by a large
majority, and re-elected at every succeeding election until 1898, when
he retired from active political life. In 1890, September 10, four years
after he was first elected, he joined the Mowat Government without
Portfolio and held a similar position when the Hardy Government was
formed. Had he so desired he could probably have remained a member of
the local Legislature even to this date, as few, if any, in Ottawa were
or are more appreciated or ever received more popularity than the same
Hon. Erskine Henry Bronson. The poor of the city, to whom his firm in
winter time never failed to extend the helping hand in furnishing them
with winter fuel and in other ways, could never forget, nor overlook,
his kindly and substantial consideration of their needs and his name
was, and is to-day, cherished in every home. To others, with whom he
came in contact, he was always a valuable friend and counsellor, and his
advice on financial and other matters was eagerly sought and freely
given. On his father’s decease Mr. Bronson succeeded him as President of
the Bronson-Weston Lumber Company, in 1889. He was one of the
inaugurators of the Ottawa Electric Company. Mr. Bronson is President of
the Bronson Company, Water Power and Manufacturers of Ground Wood Pulp,
150 Middle Street, Ottawa; President, Ottawa Improvement Company;
Vice-President, Ottawa Light, Heat & Power Company; President, Ottawa
Power Company, and a director of the Ottawa Electric Company. In 1874
Mr. Bronson married Ella H. Webster, of Norfolk, Va. He has one son and
one daughter. In religion he is a Presbyterian. In politics, a Liberal.
His residence is 75 Bronson Avenue, Ottawa.

=Bain, John=, Journalist, private secretary, civil servant, promoter,
and now financial broker and departmental agent and customs specialist,
Castle Building, Ottawa, came to Canada in 1888 and engaged in law and
newspaper work. Later he was engaged as expert shorthand writer in the
New York law courts. When the Liberal Party was returned to power in
1896 he was appointed Private Secretary to the Minister of Customs, Hon.
Wm. Patterson, and accompanied the Minister to England in 1902, doing
the secretarial work there connected with the trade questions that were
discussed at the Colonial Conference. His services were also utilized in
connection with the trade negotiations with the French Government at
Paris. He held the position of Assistant Commissioner of Customs of
Canada for five years, and was Secretary of the Tariff Commission of
1906-07. He promoted and organized the Canadian Western Natural Gas,
Light, Heat and Power Company, Calgary. He was appointed Imperial Trade
Correspondent for Ottawa District for the British Board of Trade in
1909. Although one of the old, steadfast and prominent Liberals in the
capital, he joined and became active in the ranks of the Unionist Party
during the general elections in 1917, and, as publicity director,
rendered valuable service to the Unionist cause. His pithy paragraphs
and pointed questions, such as “How would the Kaiser Vote?” which were
printed in the campaign literature and in the press throughout Canada,
attracted widespread attention and were used with telling effect by the
various public speakers during the campaign. Mr. Bain is the son of
Robert and Agnes Bain and was born at Paisley, Scotland, June 8, 1869,
where he received his education. April 5, 1899, he married Maude
Buckley, daughter of P. Buckley, Paris, Ontario, and has two
daughters—Audrey Maie, born 1900, and Alison Muriel, born 1903. In
politics Mr. Bain is a Liberal, in religion a Presbyterian. His
residence is 167 James St. He is a member of the Laurentian Club,
Ottawa, and the Ranchman’s, Calgary.

=De Celles, Alfred Duclos, LL.D., F.R.S.C., C.M.G.=, Chevalier of the
Legion of Honor, General Librarian of Parliament, was born at St.
Laurent, near Montreal, in 1844, and was educated at Laval University,
Quebec, where he graduated in letters. He is the son of Augustin D. De
Celles, a prominent notary, and Agnes Holmes, an American lady. Abbé
John Holmes, a noted preacher in Quebec, related to O. W. Holmes, was
his uncle. In October, 1876, he married Eugenie Dorion, daughter of
Eugene Dorion and Mary Panet, and has one son, Alfred Eugene De Celles.
He is a distinguished Canadian litterateur and publicist. For a time he
was a member of the Board of Civil Service Examiners. In 1867, Mr. De
Celles, on account of ill-health, left the Laval University to take up
the editorial chair of “Le Journal de Quebec” during Mr. Cauchon’s
absence in Europe. On the return of the latter he remained connected
with the paper until 1872, when he entered the “Minerve”, chief
Conservative paper of the province of Quebec, as editor-in-chief. He
remained there until 1880, when he was appointed assistant librarian of
the Parliamentary Library of Ottawa. In 1886, he became joint librarian
with Mr. Martin J. Griffin. For several years after he entered the
Library he had charge of “L’Opinion Publique,” a weekly paper published
in Montreal, chiefly devoted to literature and history. Mr. De Celles,
in 1896, published a History of the United States under the following
title: “Les Etats-Unis, origine—institutions—development.” For this
work he received a prize from the Academie des Sciences Morales et
Politiques of France. A few years later he wrote in English, the Life of
Papineau and Cartier, in “The Makers of Canada.” This work was
subsequently published in French, in an enlarged form, together with a
Life of Cartier, the three volumes forming a political history of
Canada. Reviewing Mr. De Celles’ Papineau, the London “Outlook” (Jan.
13, 1906) summed up this work as follows: “Mr. De Celles has traced this
out through the quarter of a century in which Papineau was the most
brilliant, if not the most wise figure in French-Canadian politics, with
the natural sympathy of a compatriot, though by no means without due
recognition of his hero’s failings. . . . He has given us an admirable
picture of a strange and picturesque career. Everyone has heard of
Papineau, and most Canadians have some idea of his achievements, but
little probably of his personality.” Mr. De Celles has also contributed
to “Canada and Its Provinces,” a synopsis of the History of Quebec under
Confederation and an extensive history of colonization under this title:
“The Habitant”: and an outline of the municipal system in Lower Canada.
He has contributed to The Chronicles of Canada the “Patriotes of 1837,”
a history of the Canadian Rebellion. In 1904, he was named Chevalier de
la Legion d’Honneur, and in 1907 received the title of C.M.G. In 1884,
he was received Member of the Royal Society, and since 1903 he has
occupied the post of President of l’Alliance Française. Mr. De Celles is
in religion a Catholic, and he resides in Ottawa.

General Conference officials, he became Book Steward Emeritus. Under his
management great progress has been made, and the Book Room is, without a
doubt, one of the most profitable publishing houses in Canada to-day. It
has grown year after year on a steady basis, and the large number of
employees engaged is an indication that business must be going on
regularly to carry a staff numbering in the hundreds. The mechanical
departments are manned with all the latest devices in machinery and
everything has been so arranged that the largest publication can be

=Thomson, Levi= (Wolseley, Sask.), Member of Parliament for Qu’Appelle,

February 17, 1855, and was educated in common school and Rockwood
Academy. After legal studies in Toronto he emigrated to the North-West
Territories in 1882, and engaged in farming near Wolseley, Sask., where
he now resides. Twelve years later Mr. Thomson commenced the practice of
law at Wolseley and was appointed Crown Prosecutor in 1897, which
position he resigned seven years later, but became Agent of the
Attorney-General of Saskatchewan for Moosomin Judicial District in 1906.
The future legislator was not long in making himself felt in the public
life of his community, being elected a member of the Wolseley Rural
Municipality in 1887, an office which he resigned after three years’
term only to become Councillor of the Town of Wolseley in 1902-3, and
finally Mayor, in 1904. In the same year Levi Thomson was the Liberal

constituency for the Saskatchewan Legislature a year later he was
unsuccessful by the even smaller majority of 20; but finally achieved
his ambition in 1911, being returned to the Federal House for
Qu’Appelle, with a handsome majority. Despite political activities, Mr.
Thomson has always retained his interest in farming and was the first

=Brock, William Rees=, the late, was born on February 14, 1836, in the
Township of Eramosa, near Guelph, Ontario. His father Thomas Rees Brock,
was of an ancient English family who were landed proprietors near
Colchester in the County of Essex. His mother was Eleanor Thompson,
daughter of Thomas Thompson, of Rusheen, Queen’s County, Ireland. The
young couple, aged respectively 17 and 21 years, were married at the
Parish Church in Guelph and after the ceremony rode on horseback to
their new home five miles away in “the wild woods.” After a few years of
life on the farm Mr. Brock was persuaded that a man of his education and
attainments could do better in the town and he removed to Guelph where
he held several appointments as Town Auditor, Secretary of the School
Board, Superintendent of the Government Road and Surrogate Court Clerk.
In the fall of 1850, while out shooting in the woods, he was
accidentally shot and died at his residence, Park Place, a few days
afterwards, aged thirty-eight years, leaving his widow with nine
children surviving. The stone house he built on the York Road is still
standing. The subject of this sketch was the second child and eldest
son. He immediately left the Guelph Grammar School and went into the law
office of the Hon. Ferguson Blair, where he remained about a year,
deciding to enter commercial life, in which he achieved so conspicuous a
success. His first employment was in a general store in Caledonia. About
1854 he located in Toronto, being engaged with Scott & Laidlaw. He
married on the 23rd of September, 1857, Margaret Anna, second daughter
of Captain John Segur Diamond, formerly of Clonenagh, Queen’s County,
Ireland, who came to Canada in 1834, and served through the rebellion of
1837 as Adjutant of the 2nd Gore Regiment. Capt. Diamond was at one time
in the Royal Irish Constabulary and after his arrival in this country
was engaged in business with Colonel Chisholm, of Oakville, and others,
as lumbermen and vessel owners. He had died some nine years previously
to his daughter’s marriage. After his marriage, Mr. Brock went into
business in Guelph, but later sold out and entered the service of
McArthur & Co., of Bowmanville, where he remained about four-and-a-half
years, subsequently went to Ogilvy & Co., Montreal, wholesale merchants,
was English buyer for that firm for some years; was made a partner and
came to Toronto in 1871, and opened Ogilvy & Company’s Toronto branch.
In 1877, in partnership with his brother, J. H. Brock, he started the
business of W. R. Brock & Brother, at the corner of Bay and Wellington
Streets, Toronto. In 1879 a partnership was formed with Messrs. F. Wyld
and H. W. Darling, as Wyld, Brock & Darling. Mr. Darling retired in
1883, and Mr. Wyld in 1887. The firm of W. R. Brock & Company was turned
into a joint stock company in 1897. The Montreal branch was started in
1899, and the branch at Calgary in 1905. Besides being President of the
W. R. Brock Company, Ltd., he was a director of the Dominion Lands
Colonization Co., the British Canadian Loan and Investment Co., Toronto
Electric Light Co., Electrical Development Co., Ontario Accident
Insurance Co., Toronto General Trust Corporation and the Dominion Bank.
He was also President of the British American and Western Assurance
Companies, the Stanstead Granite Quarries Company, London Electric Light
Company, and the Canadian General Electric Company. Mr. Brock was one of
the founders of the “Empire” newspaper, Toronto, and served as President
of the company until its amalgamation with “The Mail” in 1895. For years
he was President of the Toronto Conservative Association and sat in the
House of Commons for Centre Toronto in the Conservative interest from
1900 to 1904. Mr. Brock was also a director and a leading spirit in many
philanthropic organizations. He was a founder and President of the
Toronto Humane Society, a life member of the Council of Trinity
University and of Upper Canada College, and benefactor of both
institutions. He was a member of the congregation of St. James’
Cathedral, and from 1883 to 1890 was a churchwarden. His clubs were:
Toronto Club, York Club, Albany Club, Toronto Hunt Club, Toronto; The
Rideau Club, Ottawa; and St. James’ Club, Montreal. His surviving
children are Lt.-Col. Henry Brock, Lt.-Col. R. A. Brock, Mr. W. L.
Brock, and the Misses Lilian, Gertrude, and Muriel Brock. Mr. Brock died
at his residence, 21 Queen’s Park, Toronto, on November 1, 1917. He was
almost eighty-two years of age, and actively engaged in business up to
within a few days of his death. Although advanced in years Mr. Brock
retained his keen business acumen right through and served to the last
in an advisory capacity to the directors of the W. R. Brock Company. By
virtue of exceptional ability, organizing genius, hard work,
adaptability, generosity and an appreciative attitude toward those in
his employment, he was able to develop one of the outstanding mercantile
houses of the Dominion. He held the esteem of the merchants in
practically all the primary markets of the world. In Canadian industry
he was declared to be an international figure. The memory of William
Rees Brock will long live as a man noted for his commercial integrity,
splendid philanthropy, and public enterprises. He was endowed with a
winning personality, and his influence in public affairs was always for
good. He was a staunch supporter of British Connection, and believed in
promoting closer trade relations between Canada and the Mother Country.
He lived a long, useful, and upright life, an inspiration to others, who
would merit the approval of their fellows, and the close of a career so
full of years and honors was regarded as a public loss.

occasioned principally by the South African War in 1900 and 1901, made
it necessary to form a limited company, viz., the W. H. Dwyer Co., Ltd.,

extent that some years ago offices were opened at Montreal and Fort
William and, in 1917, a subsidiary company was formed in Winnipeg under

=Bethune, the Rev. Charles Jas. Stewart, M.A., D.C.L.=, the
distinguished subject of this sketch, was born at West Flamboro’,
Ontario, on August 11, 1838. He is the third son of the Right Rev.
Alexander Neil Bethune second Bishop of Toronto, and Jane Eliza, eldest
daughter of the late Hon. James Crooks. The Bethune family traces its
lineage very far back in Scottish and French historical records. The
first of the name who left Normandy for the British Isles came to
Scotland in the reign of Malcolm the Third, a contemporary of William
the Conqueror, in the eleventh century. The first of the family to come
to Canada was the Rev. John Bethune, a U.E. Loyalist from North
Carolina, and chaplain to a Highland regiment, who settled with his
comrades in the county of Glengarry, Ontario, towards the end of the
18th century. He was the father of the late Bishop of Toronto and Dean
Bethune, of Montreal, and grandfather of the subject of this sketch.
Young Bethune was educated at private schools at Cobourg and Upper
Canada College, Toronto. After leaving the latter institution he entered
Trinity College, Toronto, and graduated therefrom in 1859 with
first-class classical honors and the B.A. degree. He took his M.A. in
1861, and received the honorary degree of D.C.L. from his Alma Mater in
1883, in recognition of his zealous and worthy services at Trinity
College School. He was ordained deacon in 1861 and priest in 1862, by
the late Bishop Strachan of Toronto. He was curate until 1866, with his
father, then Rector of Cobourg, with the exception of a short period
spent in England in 1863-64, when he was curate at Carlton, near Selby,
in Yorkshire. In 1866 he was appointed to the charge of the Credit
Mission in the County of Peel, Ont., where he was instrumental in
building the churches at Dixie and Port Credit. In September, 1870, he
was appointed Head Master of Trinity College School at Port Hope. From a
very small beginning he raised up this school to be one of the most
widely known and successful in the Dominion. He had a staff of eight
assistant masters, about 140 pupils, and large and handsome buildings
with extensive grounds. He resigned the headmastership in 1899, and
removed to London, Ontario, where he remained for seven years. During
the greater part of that period he was curator and librarian of the
Entomological Society of Ontario. He assisted in forming the London
Horticultural Society and was its president for two years. Dr. Bethune
gave much of his attention to scientific pursuits and he is well known
in the United States and Great Britain, as likewise in Canada, as an
entomologist. He was one of the founders of the Entomological Society of
Ontario and its Secretary-Treasurer for seven years. He was president of
the same society from 1870 to 1875, and has continued since to be a
member of its council. He was entomological editor of the “Canada
Farmer” for nine years, and editor of the “Canadian Entomologist” from
its inception in 1868 to 1873, and from 1887 to 1909, when he was
elected editor emeritus. He has written a large number of papers on
Practical and Scientific Entomology in these and other publications, and
contributed repeatedly to the annual report on insects presented to the
Legislature of Ontario. He is a Fellow of the American Association for
the advancement of Science and has attended its meetings at various
places in the United States, is a member of several Canadian scientific
societies and a corresponding member of scientific societies in New
York, Philadelphia, Boston, Buffalo, Davenport, Brooklyn, Halifax, and
other places. He is also a member of the Corporation of the University
of Trinity College. He was Honorary Clerical Secretary of the Synod of
the Diocese of Toronto from 1869 to 1871, and has been repeatedly
elected a representative of the diocese at the meetings of the
Provincial Synod in Montreal. He was a delegate from the diocese of
Toronto to the general synod of the Church of England in Canada at
Winnipeg in 1896, and was appointed clerical secretary of the Lower
House in 1902, holding that position at the meetings in Montreal and
Quebec and resigning at the Ottawa meeting in 1908; elected Fellow of
the Royal Society of Canada in 1892, and became President of Section 4
in the year 1900; was one of the original promoters of the Sisterhood of
St. John the Divine in Toronto and filled the position of Warden for
some years. On the first of June, 1906, he was appointed Professor of
Entomology and Zoology at the Ontario Agricultural College, Guelph,
which position he still holds. He assisted in the formation of the
American Association of Economic Entomologists and of the American
Entomological Society; of the latter he is one of the original Fellows.
He was elected President of the Entomological Society of Ontario for its
Jubilee year, 1913. He is Honorary President of the Wellington Field
Naturalists’ Club, of the Guelph Horticultural Society and of the
Trinity College School Cricket Club. Since going to Guelph he has
published bulletins on insects affecting fruit trees and vegetables of
which several editions have been issued by the Department of Agriculture
of Ontario. He has frequently visited England and travelled in the
United States and Europe. Dr. Bethune has always been a member of the
Church of England and associated with the “High Church” school of
thought. He married on April 21, 1863, Alice, second daughter of
Lieut.-Colonel Forlong, K.H., of Toronto, late of Her Majesty’s 43rd
Regiment of Light Infantry, and his wife, Sophia, daughter of the Hon.
Henry John Boulton, of Holland House, Toronto. Mrs. Bethune died in
July, 1898. Dr. Bethune has four children living. His eldest son, Arthur
M. Bethune, is Manager of the Hamilton Branch of the Dominion Bank, and
Reginald A. Bethune is an officer in the Civil Service at Kamloops, B.C.
The two daughters are unmarried. An earnest and able worker for his
church, a learned and deeply skilled votary in a wide and important
branch of science, it has been given to few men whose names are written
in this volume to accomplish so much and to accomplish it so well.

=Clark, John Murray, M.A., LL.B., K.C.= (Toronto, Ont.), born at St.
Mary’s, Ont., July 6, 1860, of Scottish descent, his parents being James
and Isabella Clark. Educated at St. Mary’s Collegiate Institute, Toronto
University and Osgoode Hall. His career at the University was
particularly brilliant. He won the prize in Logic awarded by the late
Professor J. P. Young, the Blake Scholarship on Constitutional Law,
Economics and Jurisprudence, the McMurrich Medal in Natural Science and
Gold Medal in Mathematics and Physics, and the prize on Minority
Representation, graduating with the degree of B.A. in 1882, M.A. 1884,
LL.B. 1891, and being called to the Bar in 1886, with honours, and
winning the Law Society’s Gold Medal, since which time he has practised
in Toronto where he is recognized as one of the leaders of the Bar and
is head of the firm of Clark, McPherson, Campbell & Jarvis. Has been
retained as Counsel in a large number of cases of great magnitude and
importance, such as the Quaker Case, Ontario Express Company, Fisheries
Case, and the Ophir case, and has frequently pleaded before the Privy
Council in England. Appointed a K.C. in 1889; in early life was
Mathematical Master of St. Mary’s Collegiate Institute and for several
years Examiner in Physics, Toronto University, of which he was appointed
as Senator in 1892. Is also Vice-President Toronto University Alumni
Association. Formerly President Mathematical and Physics Society and
University College Literary and Scientific Society. Few men in Canada
have exhibited more scholarly attainments than the subject of this
sketch, whose versatility in Science, Literature, as well as original
research has been remarkable, and of great benefit. Notwithstanding the
high place which Mr. Clark occupies in the field of letters and the wide
knowledge he has of science and literature, he is widely known on
account of his great abilities as a lawyer which have placed him in the
front rank of the legal profession in Canada. Many of his cases have
been of first-class importance and some of them of great public
interest. Among the first in which he won a signal victory was that of
Dorland and Jones, the famous Quaker Case from Prince Edward County,
Ontario. The recent decision of the House of Lords, giving the “Wee
Frees” the property of the Free Church of Scotland recalls the Quaker
Case here. Mr. Clark argued before the Supreme Court at Ottawa that the
Church had the right to make changes in its Constitution, even though
that Constitution itself did not specifically authorize it to do so. The
view was adopted by the United Free Church lawyers in Edinburgh in the
case arising from the union of the Free and United Presbyterian Churches
of Scotland, and the Court of Session, the High Court of Justice
sustained that view. The “Wee Free” (as the Free Church minority was
commonly called), appealed to the House of Lords, and contrary to all
expectation, won, and obtained possession of the vast property of the
Church. The situation was so tense that a special Act of Parliament was
passed to adjust conditions. In quite a number of constitutional cases
reaching through the Canadian Courts to the Privy Council, Mr. Clark has
figured, and invariably with success. The same is true regarding
commercial cases and large mining cases in which a long and extended
experience has given him such a mastery as few of his compeers possess.
Quite recently the “Ophir” mining case, which he brought to a successful
conclusion, through a tedious and tortuous course of litigation, ending
in the Privy Council, has excited the attention of the legal profession
and of the public, both because it decided the question of the Indian
title so far as Ontario is concerned, and because a similar situation is
becoming acute in British Columbia. Mr. Clark has made several notable
speeches in England where he is regarded as an accomplished jurist, and
few men are so well versed in the political and constitutional history
of this Dominion or more fully seized of its great resources. The London
“Times” and several other prominent English papers a few years ago
referred in high praise to Mr. Clark’s speech on “Canada and the Navy”
delivered before a notable gathering, including Lord Strathcona the late
High Commissioner for Canada. Mr. Clark is one of the foremost
mathematical authorities in Canada and his work has been commended by so
high an authority as Lord Kelvin, while he is regarded both in this
country and in England as an authority on Constitutional law. He has won
distinction as an author, and has written several standard works and
papers, among which may be mentioned “Law of Mines in Canada,” which was
written in collaboration with the Hon. W. D. McPherson, Provincial
Secretary of Ontario. “Company Law,” “The Ontario Mining Law,”
“International Arbitration,” “Canada’s Future and the Empire,” “History
of the Theory of Energy,” and “The Functions of a great University.” Has
lectured on the “Value of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council,”
“Canada and the Navy,” etc. The work on Mining Law referred to is
recognized as an authority on the subject dealt with, and has been
highly praised by the Harvard Law Review of the Law Magazine of England
as well as by the Canadian Press. The “Mining Journal” stated that “the
book had the impress of clear and legal learning,” and the work has also
been described as a monument of research, care and industry. Recently
Mr. Clark has been elected President of the Royal Canadian Institute,
founded by Sir John Lefroy (whose grandson, Lieut. Lefroy, gallantly
fell on Vimy Ridge). In referring to the new President’s appointment
“The Mail and Empire” said: “Mr. Clark well represents the best that we
have in character, intellect, scholarship and public spirit. A
distinguished graduate of Toronto University, the new President, far
from leaving the avenues of learning, as some do when they graduate, has
ever increased his stores, and has successfully striven not only to
broaden and deepen his knowledge, but to devote it to the service of his
fellow-men, as witness Mr. Clark’s strong and convincing advocacy of the
Canadian Government availing itself of the great scientific attainments
and progressive scholarship of men like Professors Macallum and
McLennan. For many years one of the foremost advocates in Canada of that
great constitutional change in Imperial relations which is to-day being
forged on the anvil of war, Mr. Clark has been a powerful and sagacious
leader in that movement on this side of the water. In the prosecution of
that enterprise he has deservedly won the regard and friendship of some
of the leading scholars and statesmen of our Empire.” The “Globe,” in
the course of a favorable review, said that his Presidential Address on
“The Reign of Law,” “will appeal to thoughtful readers as a scholarly
contribution to a subject which derives fresh interest from the war.”
Mr. Clark has given considerable study to the question of our gold
supply which has proved a potent factor in the financing of the great
war, and will be even a more important factor in the reconstruction
period after the war according to the viewpoint of Mr. Clark, who takes
the position that the increase in the production of gold be encouraged
in every practical way. Politically, Mr. Clark has always been a member
of the Liberal Party, and was formerly President of the Young Men’s
Liberal Club of Toronto, but, in the Federal general elections of 1917
he supported the Union Government. He favors Canada remaining an
integral portion of the British Empire, the utmost practicable extension
of the principle of free trade, and the development of a vigorous
Canadian National Sentiment. Married first Greta Helen Gordon, daughter
of Rev. D. Gordon, and sister of “Ralph Connor,” 1890 (deceased 1894);
second, Annie Macleod Anderson, daughter of late W. N. Anderson,
Toronto, 1899 (deceased, 1910); third, Caroline Chaplin, daughter of

=Paisley, Jas. K.= (Ottawa). One of the best known and highly respected
citizens in the Capital of the Dominion and in many other parts of
Canada, both east and west, is the subject of this sketch. Following in
his father’s footsteps, who owned and successfully ran a popular hotel
in Orangeville, at an early age he became, and for years remained,
cashier of the well known hostelry—the Walker House, Toronto. His
experiences in that popular public resort and his popularity prompted
aspirations and ambitions which caused him to launch out in enterprises
of his own, and he soon became proprietor of several of the best hotels
in the principal cities and summer resorts in Canada. In 1902 he was one
of the owners of the New Royal in Hamilton where business success and
increased patronage prompted the owners to remodel it in 1907. He took
management of the Penetanguishene Hotel at Penetang and made it one of
the attractive features of the place. He reached out and got management
of the Sans Souci at Moon River, the Belvidere in Parry Sound, the
Iroquois Hotel in Toronto, the Victoria Hotel at Aylmer, Quebec, the
Grand Union, Ottawa, and, with the late Daniel O’Connor, built the
Temagami Inn at Temagami, Ontario. In each and all these ventures
success and popularity followed in his train and created for him
unstinted fame as an enterprising, progressive and popular hotel
proprietor and manager. And while so actively engaged in the hotel
business Mr. Paisley, being an enthusiastic lover of the horse, found
time to give to that noble animal the most assiduous care and attention,
and much of his time for years was devoted to the purchase, the raising,
and the training of some of the finest saddle, harness and trotting
steeds to be found in any part of Canada. They established, for their
owner, on many a race track and at many a horse show enviable records.
His Sealskin Joe was one of those that won distinction on the Winnipeg
racecourse many years ago. Later his saddle horse, Jardie, was accorded
the admiration of all. Shortly after his arrival in Ottawa, where he
first established himself as proprietor of the Grand Union Hotel, he
became interested in such affairs—public, charitable, patriotic and
social—as had for their goal the prosperity of the city and the
happiness and betterment of its people, and his many years activity in
these lines are well marked in the memory of thousands. Mr. Paisley,
never allowing his enthusiasm for the horse to die, took a keen interest
in, and became one of the original members of, the Ottawa Hunt Club; was
Treasurer of the Horse Show while it exhibited here; became Chairman of
the Construction Committee that built the Connaught Park Jockey Club
Track, and is now a director and one of the Management Committee of the
Connaught Park Jockey Club. For years Mr. Paisley has been a Director of
the Central Canada Exhibition Association, and held the office of
Vice-President, and for a considerable time was Chairman of the Special
Attraction Committee. In 1915, owing to the resignation of Mr. Edward
McMahon, who had held the position of Manager and Secretary of the
Central Canada Exhibition Association for over twenty years, and to
replace whose efficient management the Association had to select a
competent and reliable successor, Mr. James K. Paisley was chosen, with
the result that up to date the fair has been an increased success
financially and in attendance. In his management of the Exhibition’s
affairs he carries with him a geniality and a business acumen that
attracts, establishes confidence, and produces good results. When the
Great War broke out, Mr. Paisley’s son, familiarly known as “Pep”
Paisley, who had graduated from McGill as an architect, enlisted with A.
Battery, R.C.H.A., as a gunner and was soon, owing to meritorious
conduct at the front, promoted to a Lieutenancy. His valor and good work
at the firing line received much praise from his superior officers. Mr.
James K. Paisley is the son of John Paisley and Mrs. M. J. Kenniston of
Orangeville, Ontario. He was born in 1858 and was educated in
Orangeville High School and Rockwood Academy. In 1888 he married Minnie
Bairdsall Harris, daughter of the late Isaac Harris. He has one son and
two daughters. His recreations are sports of any kind. He is an active
member of the Elks, the Knights of Pythias, and the Foresters, and an
executive member of the Hotelmen’s Mutual Benefit Association of America
and Canada, Ex-President of the Ontario Hotel Keepers’ Association, and
Ex-President of the Ottawa Hotelmen’s Association. In religion he is a
Protestant, English Church. In politics a Conservative, and his address
is Kenniston Apartments, Elgin Street, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.

=Cowan, William Frederick, The Late=, who died on October 28, 1918, at
his home in Oshawa, Ont., was long one of the noted industrial and
financial leaders of Ontario. He was born in 1832, at Fintona, County
Tyrone, Ireland, the son of Thomas and Charlotte Cowan. In 1841, his
parents having decided to remove to Canada, he made with them the long
sailing and overland voyage to Toronto, the journey occupying some
months. Shortly after the family’s arrival the father died and the
mother of the subject of this sketch was left with five young children.
She managed, however, to give her boys a good education at Boyd’s
Academy, Bay St., Toronto (conducted by the father of the late
Chancellor Sir John Boyd) and one of the pioneer educational
institutions of Toronto. On leaving school, W. F. Cowan first found
employment with “The Colonist,” a newspaper founded by Sir Francis
Hincks, an eminent statesman of the mid-nineteenth century. Subsequently
he entered the employ of Alexander Laurie & Co., dry goods merchants, at
the south-west corner of King and Yonge Sts., Toronto. Later he served
with Walter McFarland & Co., dry goods merchants, on Market Square, King
St. East, Toronto, then the heart of the retail district. In 1856 he and
his brother John founded a dry goods business of their own, at the
south-west corner of Yonge and Richmond Sts., Toronto. In 1862 he
removed to Oshawa, establishing a large general store, and with a branch
at Prince Albert some twenty miles north of the town. A few years later
he acquired an interest in the A. S. Whiting Mfg. Co. of Cedar Dale,
manufacturers of scythes, forks, hoes, etc., the firm becoming Messrs.
Whiting & Cowan. Largely through Mr. Cowan’s modern methods of business
organization, the wares of this firm became known throughout America;
and Mr. Cowan was also successful in developing a large market for them
in Great Britain. In 1872, in conjunction with Messrs. Wood &
Winterbourne, of Albany, N.Y., he founded the Ontario Malleable Iron
Co., of which Mr. D. S. Wood was the first president, and on his death
was succeeded by Mr. Cowan’s elder brother John. On the latter’s death
Mr. W. F. Cowan succeeded to the Presidency. He had been a director of
the company since its inception. He was largely instrumental in making
Oshawa one of the leading industrial centres of the province. In 1893 he
established Fittings, Ltd., of Oshawa, of which he was also President at
the time of his death. Altogether his interests furnished steady
employment to about 1,000 citizens of the town, of which he was
recognized as the industrial leader. Mr. Cowan’s financial interests
were even more widely extended. In 1875 he became Vice-President of the
newly formed Standard Bank of Canada, and in 1883, on the death of the
President, the well-known capitalist, Hon. T. N. Gibbs, succeeded to
that office, in which he continued until his demise, making weekly
journeys to Toronto to attend meetings of the board until within a few
days of his death. In 1886, in company with Mr. T. H. McMillan, he also
established the Western Bank of Canada, which, after twenty-six years of
active life, was amalgamated with the Standard Bank in 1912. Though
often pressed to enter Federal and Provincial politics, he contented
himself solely with municipal service and held the post of Reeve of
Oshawa, and of Mayor, after its incorporation as a town, for some years.
He was a steadfast adherent of the Anglican Church in religion, and a
Conservative in politics. In 1864 he married Susan, daughter of the late
John Groves, a well-known citizen of Toronto. On his death he left one
son, Mr. Frederick W. Cowan, of Oshawa, who succeeds to his interests,
and one grandson, Major R. C. Cowan, who has been overseas for the past
three years.

organizations for the promotion of temperance, social welfare and the
moral uplift of the city. He is Vice-President of the Ontario Branch of
the Dominion Temperance Alliance and Vice-President of the Moral and
Social Reform League. Father Minehan is as famous for his gifts as a
pulpit orator as for his eloquence as a platform speaker. His magnetic
personality, frankness and loyalty have given him an assured place in
the esteem of all classes. He is a man of indefatigable energy, opposed
to intolerance and bigotry, with a mind fixed on the promotion of the
highest ideals in all walks of life. He is a frequent contributor to the
press, and is a writer of force and choice diction. His reverence favors
a Canadian Navy and the development of a policy of protection under the
British Flag. He exercises a wide influence both as a clergyman and a
private citizen, and at his Silver Jubilee, in 1909, was presented with
many proofs of his personal worth, and great popularity. Of him it has
been said that he is “truly Catholic in spirit and in service and
charity.”

having been Morin. His career as a business man, banker and broker, has
been a successful one, his connection with sundry influential exploiting
firms having given him an influence in public circles which has been

Apartments Company, and President of L’Evenement Publishing Company. He
is President of the Amable Belanger, Ltd., Manufacturing Co., Montmagny,
and of the General Car & Machinery Works of the same place. His
prominence as a successful business man and his influence as a
public-spirited citizen, did not fail to bring him into touch with the
political circles of the Conservative Party; and in the year 1911 he was
elected a Member of the Federal Parliament for Montmagny. While a member
of the House of Commons, his influence as a deliberate speaker and his
industry as a member of committees were acknowledged by all associated
with him in parliamentary work; and, when the vacancy occurred on the
Harbor Commission of Quebec, on the withdrawal of Sir William Price, he
was selected to succeed the latter as Chairman of that Board. In July,
1917, he was called to the Senate. His efforts to improve the harbor
facilities of the port of Quebec have been appreciated and seconded by
the Federal Government and his associates in office, with due
recognition of his public spirit and energy by his fellow-citizens and
the country at large. In 1888, he married Miss Clara Dionne, of Ste.
Anne de la Pocatiere, of the Province of Quebec. Their family residence
is on Ste. Genevieve Avenue, and their summer residence at Percé, Co. of

which he has his home. He is a loyal Quebecer. As a Conservative, he has
won an influential place in his party. And as a philanthropist he has

=MacLean, Archie=, R.R. No. 4, Paisley, Ont., was born in Bruce
Township, County of Bruce, in 1868, of Highland Scotch parents, and
glories in the fact that he has Highland Scotch blood flowing through
his veins. He attended the public school in the section in which he
lived until he was about thirteen years of age, when, being the eldest
of the family, he had to leave school to assist on the farm. His
ambition for an education was unquenched and he studied at home, and at
the age of twenty-one took a three-months’ course in the public school,
secured his matriculation. He went to Port Elgin and Walkerton High
School and succeeded in creditably securing a second-class certificate.
He taught school for a few years, but the profession at that time not
being over-remunerative, he again took up farming, and also engaged in
grazing and shipping cattle, which occupation he still successfully
follows. In 1901 he was elected to the Township of Bruce Council, where
he served for two years. In 1903-4 he was elected to Reeveship of the
Township. In 1910 he again contested the Reeveship successfully and held
the office until 1912. This office he did not covet for office sake, but
being enthused with the true spirit of co-operation for the benefit of
all he set the log rolling for the establishment of a municipal
telephone system, for the benefit of nine different municipalities, his
own native township being the initiating one. This enterprise is now
looked upon as the greatest example of co-operation in the whole county.
In his efforts he was ably seconded by men who caught his vision. He is
at present one of a commission of three, the other two being, D.
McNaughton, Ex-M.P.P., and J. J. Hunter, who handle the business of this
system. Mr. MacLean is a man of splendid executive ability, which has
been shown by his able judgment in all public enterprises with which he
has been connected. It has been said that the farmer needs ideas. In his
case he has ideas—big ones—and is not afraid to champion them even in
the face of strong opposition. He is a leader and a safe one to follow,
because of his canny Scotch nature. He is a good public speaker and has
such splendid control of himself that he has never been known to show
anger even under trying circumstances. In patriotic endeavor he is
always to the fore, having done his part ably and conscientiously ever
since the war began. As yet he has not taken unto himself a wife. He is
a Liberal in politics, and his name has often been mentioned in
connection with Parliamentary honors. He is a member of Port Elgin
Lodge, No. 429, A.F. & A.M., Camp McCrimmon, S.O.S., and the I.O.O.F.
His genial good nature, wide knowledge of municipal affairs and splendid
physique, make him an outstanding farmer in any company.

life. Having attended the Catholic Commercial Academy and St. Mary’s

marked business ability, which he displayed at an early age, and a
winning personality are due his rapid rise, and present recognized

happy results, and is at present a member of the executive. Of broad
opinions, and liberal views, he has been described as “a thorough-going
Canadian.” He is an ardent admirer of British institutions, with a fine
pride of his own race and its splendid traditions. His opinions on
economic questions, of which he has been a close student, are held in
the highest regard and his addresses before the Canadian Credit Men’s
Association on “Credit and Co-operation,” and before the Wholesale
Grocers’ Guild, on “Evolution of a Credit Plan” were considered masterly
expositions of the subjects dealt with. Mr. Hebert has had a
distinguished military career. He served with the 65th Regiment, Mount
Royal Rifles, as private, 1882; saw active service in the North-west
Rebellion, 1885; promoted to Sergeant and Captain, and retired with the

which characterizes the educated French-Canadian. He married Blanche

=Robertson, Norman= (Walkerton, Ont.), author of “The History of the
County of Bruce,” and Treasurer of the County of Bruce, Walkerton, Ont.,
was born on June 27, 1845, in Belleville, Ontario. His father, Peter
Robertson, was a merchant of Scottish birth and the son of a
Presbyterian minister, at Kilmaurs, Ayrshire. Mr. Robertson’s mother,
Sarah Ross, was born in England, although of Highland descent, her
grandfather being one of those who followed “Bonnie Prince Charlie” into
England in 1745. Norman Robertson attended the Grammar School at
Belleville, but left school when only eleven years of age, that he might
accompany his father and assist him in his business when he came to the
County of Bruce and settled at Kincardine in 1856. The disadvantage
arising from leaving school at so early an age was in part overcome by
private study and tuition. In 1863 he went to Montreal, taking a
position in a wholesale dry goods warehouse, rising to the position of
English buyer. In 1877 he returned to Kincardine and took over the
business of his father, who retired. He was married at Montreal in 1871,
to Lilla M. Warren, daughter of S. R. Warren, builder of church organs
at Montreal, and afterwards at Toronto. His family consists of three
sons and two daughters. In religion Mr. Robertson is a Presbyterian, and
has been an active worker in Sunday School work for over fifty years. In
politics he is a Conservative. The position of Treasurer of the County
of Bruce became vacant in 1887, and Mr. Robertson was chosen from among
twenty-five applicants. A desire to have put in book form and so
preserved, the records of the settlement of the County of Bruce, induced
the County Council in 1896 to offer a prize for a Historical Sketch of
the County. The sketch prepared by Mr. Robertson carried off, jointly
with another, the prize. This initial effort was followed in 1906 by a
volume of 560 pages bearing the title “The History of the County of
Bruce.” This work has been very favorably commented upon and classed as
one of the best of the County Histories of the Province that have been
published. Mr. Robertson was with the Victoria Rifles, of Montreal, when
that regiment went to the front at the time of the Fenian Raids in 1866,
and has received his military medal therefor.

securities, Mr. Sainte-Pierre has for the past few years given a great
deal of attention to the improvement of municipal borrowing. He favors
the appointment of a Government Expert Officer to safeguard and study
the best methods of borrowing money, realizing that many municipalities
have not the expert financial knowledge that enables them to decide on
the most propitious times to float loans, he believes that the suggested
reforms would be greatly in the interest, not only of the
municipalities, but of the financial houses that deal in these
securities. Mr. Sainte-Pierre, as the executive head of Credit Canada,
Limitée, has been very active in the financing of large school
municipalities and cities. His firm has handled some of the largest
issues floated in the Province of Quebec in recent years. He has made
various suggestions for the improvement of School municipalities in the
province. Mr. Sainte-Pierre is also well known as an expert accountant,
and systematizer. He is a member of several fraternal societies and it
is well recognized that the prominent position obtained by Credit

=Johnston, Ebenezer Forsyth Blackie, K.C.= (Toronto, Ont.), was born in
Berwickshire, Scotland, December 20, 1850, and received a thorough
scholastic training in his native country. He came to Canada in boyhood,
and for a short time looked to farming as an occupation and became also
interested in educational matters. The bent of his mind being in the
direction of the law, he pursued the studies thereof, and in 1876 was
sworn in as a solicitor, and in 1880 he was called to the Bar, and
practised at Guelph for a few years, where he met with big success. Upon
receiving the appointment (in 1885) as Deputy Attorney-General and Clerk
of the Executive Council, he came to Toronto, and held the position for
four years. He then resumed the practice of his profession and was

which office, by reason of his increasing practice he was compelled to
resign in 1894. He has frequently acted as Crown Counsel at the
Provincial Assizes, being retained in several important murder trials,
and in that capacity has won distinction and success, by reason of the
fact that he has perhaps conducted more criminal cases than any man in
Canada. To cite a complete or anything like a complete list of the cases
which he has been retained for, would read like a city directory. He was
a gentleman of pleasing address, yet withal a forceful orator, and had
the faculty of being in a position through his remarkable tenacity to
hold the jury and convince them to his way of thinking. He had a ready
mental grasp, quick and clear conceptions, and was ever ready to see a
point and turn it to the advantage of his client. In 1887 was appointed

=Allan, John=, Member for the riding of West Hamilton in the Ontario
Legislature, was born at Guelph, Ont., on May 22, 1856, the son of James
and Agnes (Rodgers) Allan. His boyhood was spent in the city of which he
is now an elected representative, and he was educated in the public
schools there. On leaving school in 1871 he qualified himself for
mechanical pursuits with William Hancock and John Taylor of Hamilton,
remaining with them for three years. From 1874 to 1879 he followed his
trade in the Western States and in the latter year removed to New York
City. In 1885 he became a builder on his own account in the American
metropolis and continued there for the next twenty-one years. He
prospered to an extent that in 1906, at the age of fifty, he was able to
retire from business and return to the city where he had spent his youth
and for which he had always cherished a deep affection. His friends
persuaded him to enter municipal politics in 1908 and he has proven a
most useful public servant. He was Alderman, 1908-9; Controller,
1910-12; Chairman of the Parks Board, 1911; Mayor for the years 1913 and
1914. His regime was marked by businesslike methods and he was popular
with all classes of the community. In 1914 on the retirement of Sir John
Hendrie, the present Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario, who had long
represented the riding of West Hamilton in the Ontario Legislature, Mr.
Allan was nominated by the Conservative party and elected. As a
legislator his services as a member of the standing committees of the
House are especially valued. In religion he is a Presbyterian and is a
member of the following organizations: Commercial Club, A.F. & A.M., and
Knights of Pythias. In 1881 he married Catherine, daughter of Conrad
Euler.

=Stewart, Charles=, first saw the light of day in the pioneer homestead,
lot 13, concession 11, Township of Ashfield, County of Huron. His father
was David Stewart, of Caithness, Scotland, and his mother Mary McLean,
of Ross-shire, Scotland. In 1842 this estimable Scotch couple set sail
for Canada, and that same year began their pioneer life on the homestead
now occupied by the subject of this sketch. To their son they have
imparted their sterling qualities of character. Charles Stewart received
his education in the public schools of his native county, but his heart
was ever in his chosen occupation of farming and he has become one of
the sterling sons of the soil, proud that he knows how to farm and do it
well. He is unmarried. Studious by nature, his hobby has ever been
municipal affairs, and for nine years he was a member of the municipal
council. Four of these, 1914-15-16-17, he occupied the honored position
of reeve, retiring in 1918. He was a member of Huron’s County Council,
and there as in his own council he was ever found leading in movements
for forwarding the country’s interests. He is an advocate of
Hydro-Electric and Hydro Radials, feeling that the peculiar geographical
situation of the township in which he lives can eventually be served by
these two important public utilities. He is a good debater, states his
case with Scotch deliberateness, and sticks to his point in the face of
all opposition, until convinced that there might be some better way than
the one he advocates. Kindly and generous by disposition, he has friends
by the score, and has been attested by his continuous representation in
the council for so many years. He is an ardent admirer of Highland games
and fond of good driving horses, though of late the automobile has
superseded his once famous pacer. He is perhaps one of the most
aggressive farmers in his community, and his name has from time to time
been mentioned for parliamentary honors, but he has refused to be lured
into the wider field of political activity. If he should ever run and be
elected, he will be a distinct asset to the farmers of Canada, because
he knows what they want. He is a member of Lucknow Lodge, No. 184, A.F.
& A.M. In politics he is a Liberal, and in religion a Presbyterian.

a member of the same family as the famous Col. Duncan Campbell, of
Inverawe, who was on the staff of General Lord Howe at Ticonderoga, and
whose death in that battle, and the accompanying psychical phenomena,
form the theme of one of Robert Louis Stevenson’s most thrilling

=Coats, Robert Hamilton=, Dominion Statistician and Controller of the
Census, is one of the live wires in the employ of the Dominion
Government. At college, in journalism, as an author and a writer on
economic subjects, and as a Civil Service employee, he has distinguished
himself and proved his worth. He captured the Bankers’ Scholarship in
Economics and the Wyld Prize in English at the Toronto University; and
from the time of his graduation in 1896, taking the degree of B.A. in
Classics, to the present, he has given tangible evidence of his literary
and constructive ability. Having served on the staff of the “Toronto
World” and the Toronto “Globe” from 1898 to 1901, in January, 1902, he
became Associate Editor of the “Labor Gazette,” the journal of the
Department of Labor, afterwards editor, and continued in that capacity
until 1914. On the death of Mr. Archibald Blue, in 1915, he succeeded
that gentleman as Census Commissioner. Within a brief period afterwards,
largely as a development of Mr. Coats’ constructive work, the Dominion
Bureau of Statistics was established by Act of Parliament, and its value
to the State, under Mr. Coats’ direction, is duly recognized. Robert
Hamilton Coats is the son of Robert Coats, merchant, and Mary Park. He
was born in Clinton, Ontario, July 25, 1874, and was educated at the
Toronto University (B.A., 1896). He is a contributor to the “Journal of
Economics” and other economic reviews; joint author with R. E. Gosnell
of “The Life of Sir James Douglas” (Makers of Canada Series), 1908;
author of “The Labor Movement in Canada,” and of “Special Reports on
Prices in Canada, 1890-1909-10-11-12 and 13.” In 1912 he was appointed a
member of the Royal Commission of Official Statistics of Canada, and in
1914 a member of the Cost of Living Commission. Mr. Coats is a Fellow of
the Royal Statistical Society of England, of the American Statistical
Association, of the American Economic Association, and of the Canadian
Political Science Association. In June, 1905, Mr. Coats married Marie
Halboister, of Paris, France. For recreation he favors canoeing and
ski-ing. He is a member of the Presbyterian Church and resides at 176
Manor Avenue, Rockcliffe Park, Ottawa.

=Ward, Lt.-Col. Henry Alfred=, Judge of the United Counties of
Northumberland and Durham, is the son of George Charles Ward and Harriet
Amelia (Brent). His father was fifty-four years Registrar of the County
of Durham, and of East Durham, when the County was divided into two
ridings. He was born at Port Hope, Ont., on August 20, 1849, and
educated in the local schools of his native town; called to the Bar in
1871, and created a K.C. in 1908, he successfully practised his
profession in Port Hope for many years and was Mayor for a considerable
period. Judge Ward is a grandson of Thomas Ward, who came from England
as Secretary to Attorney-General White, in 1792, settled in Toronto, and
then went to Port Hope, where he afterwards became judge of the district
of Newcastle. The subject of this sketch was for a long period in the

defeated the Hon. A. B. Aylesworth for the County of Durham, and retired
from political life in 1908. In 1916 he was elevated to the Bench, a

=Scott, William Duncan=, Superintendent of Immigration for the
Government of Canada, is one of the best known citizens of this country
both at home and in other lands. He was born at Dundas, Ont., on October
7, 1861, the son of James and Margaret (McEwen) Scott. He was educated
at Dundas High School and subsequently entered a law office with a view
to qualifying himself for the legal profession. He did not, however,
complete his studies, for the virgin country of Manitoba, which was just
then being opened up to the world, called him, as in the case of many
another young man, from Eastern Canada. He went West in 1881 at the age
of twenty and entered the service of the Canadian Pacific Railway, then
in course of construction, and later was employed by the Manitoba
Government. In 1887 he was appointed Immigration Agent for that
government with offices at Winnipeg. In 1895 he removed to the city of
Toronto and continued to act as Immigration Agent for Manitoba in that
city, incidentally helping to populate the prairie province with many
desirable settlers. His general knowledge of the resources of Canada and
his qualities of good-fellowship led to his appointment as Canadian
Commissioner at the Paris Exposition of 1899; and from thence until 1903
he acted in a similar capacity at other International exhibitions, at
which the Government of Canada was represented by displays and bureaus
of information. In the latter year he was appointed Superintendent of
the Immigration Branch of the Department of the Interior and removed to
Ottawa where he has ever since resided. The period of Mr. Scott’s
appointment was that in which immigration to the Canadian North-West not
only from Europe but from the United States was at its zenith and he was
very active in assisting to build up population in the new provinces of
Alberta and Saskatchewan. In 1911 the post of Chief Controller of
Chinese Immigration under treaties newly effected with the Government of
China was added to his duties, and he is now the most important factor
in all branches of immigration in this country, with a large staff under
his control. In addition to his official labors he pursues the calling
of a practical farmer. He is a Presbyterian in religion and his
recreation is indicated by the fact that he is a member of the Royal
Ottawa Golf and Laurentian Clubs. He is also a member of the A.F. & A.M.

=Askwith, John E.=, is Ottawa’s Police Magistrate, to which position he
was appointed by the Ontario Government, April 23, 1918. Mr. Askwith was
born in Ottawa and, practically, Ottawa has remained his home to this
day. For forty years Mr. Askwith was in business as a contractor, both
on structural and railway work and the Government Bureau, the Halifax
Armory, and many other public buildings bear testimony to his zeal. He
has been of considerable benefit and has rendered good services to the
city of Ottawa in more ways than one. For eleven years he sat in the
City Council as representative for Rideau Ward. He served as Chairman of
the Parks Commission and had much to do in the acquisition of Rockliffe
Park. In 1901 the Conservatives of Russell County selected him as their
candidate for the House of Commons and, while he met with defeat, he
gave his opponent a sharp contest. For three years he was President of
the Association for the Blind and was and is a hard worker in the
interest of the Protestant Old Men’s Home. His contributions to the
various Ottawa Public Institutions are numerous and his attentions to
them so constant and earnest that he is rightfully called an
unmistakeable philanthropist. Following in his father’s footsteps as an
enthusiast for Volunteer Military Service, Mr. Askwith served for seven
years in the Ottawa Field Battery, and on two occasions marched to the
front in defence of home and country. Even now he walks with the
military stride. Mr. Askwith was appointed Deputy Magistrate in 1907,
and since 1916 up to the time when he received his promotion in March,
1918, had to administer the law alone as during the intervening time
Magistrate O’Keefe was too ill to attend Court, and no Deputy was
appointed. In addition, as Deputy Magistrate, Mr. Askwith presided over
the Juvenile Court, and is doing so even now, and it is owing to his
sound judgment and fatherly consideration for erring youngsters that a
vast improvement has taken place in the conduct of the Juveniles in the
city. In the Police Court as well as in the Juvenile Court he has been
stern and wise in his decisions. He metes out law and justice with
common sense and discretion and never allows technicalities or quibbles
to interfere with his disposal of cases, and he holds the explicit
confidence of the public. Magistrate John E. Askwith was born of English
parents, in 1841, and was educated in the Little Red School House in
Ottawa. On September 26, 1865, he married Annie, daughter of the late
John Fotheringham, and has two sons, William R. and John F., who is a
Lieutenant in service in France; he is 36 years old and in 1915 enlisted
with a company from McGill University to reinforce the Princess Pats,
but was transferred to a Western Battalion. He went through several
important engagements in which the Canadian Forces took part, including
Vimy Ridge; and two daughters Margaret F., and Bessie, who is married to
O. E. Culbert, Barrister, Calgary. In religion Mr. Askwith is a
Protestant, and in politics a Conservative. He resides at 24 Alexander
Street, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.

=Nickle, William Folger, K.C., B.A.= (Kingston, Ont.), was born at
Kingston, Dec. 31, 1869, son of William Nickle (Scotch), and Ellen Mary

Institute, Queen’s University and Osgoode Hall; graduated from Queen’s
with degree of B.A. in 1892; called to the Bar, Osgoode Hall, 1895;
member of legal firm of Nickle, Farrell & Day, Kingston. He was twice
married: first, September 11, 1895, to Agnes Mary, daughter of Joseph
McAdam, St. Thomas; second, June 6, 1911, to Katharine Louise, daughter
of Rev. D. D. Gordon, Principal of Queen’s University. Five children,
William McAdam 1897, Douglas Joseph 1899, Evelyn Marion 1902, Alexander
Gordon 1916, and Catherine Maclennan Nickle 1918. He is a member of the
following clubs: Kingston, Country, Yacht, Frontenac, The Rideau, Ottawa
and the Toronto Club; is also a Mason, Oddfellow and a member of the
Sons of Scotland. Mr. Nickle takes an active interest in all amateur
sports. He is trustee of Queen’s University, Governor of Kingston
Hospital; elected to the Kingston School Board in 1895, City Council in
1896, and again in 1897, for three years. He was member of the
Legislative Assembly of Ontario for Kingston from 1908 to 1911, when he
resigned seat to contest same constituency at the general election for
the House of Commons, and was elected as the Liberal-Conservative
candidate, and re-elected at the general elections in December, 1917. He
is a Presbyterian in religion. The member for Kingston has played a very
active part in the city of his birth and has been prominently identified
with the municipal, educational and social life, and has carved a secure
place in the confidence and respect of his fellow-citizens. He has
greatly distinguished himself in public life, for which he has displayed
much talent, and his sterling integrity is recognized by his
fellow-members in the House of Commons. Mr. Nickle is a forceful
speaker, with a convincing style and a pleasing and magnetic
personality. His career in the House of Commons has been marked by a
spirit of independence and adherence to conviction. In 1913 he took
issue with the Government on the granting of certain additional aid to
the Canadian Northern Railway; and maintained that if the people had to
build the railroads they should own and operate them. His position at
that time has since been justified overwhelmingly by public sentiment
and the general course of events. In April of 1918 Mr. Nickle once more
achieved great prominence as the effective voice of the Canadian people
in connection with the titles controversy. He introduced a motion in the
House of Commons requesting that representations be made to the Imperial
Government that hereafter no hereditary titles should be granted in
Canada. In a speech replete with convincing historical detail on the
obsolete nature of hereditary honors he also stated his conviction that
it would be better if no further titular distinctions of any kind were
granted, except those of an officiary character. He felt, however, that
public sentiment on the question was not sufficiently ripe to permit him
to jeopardize his resolution on the subject of hereditary honors, by
making it as wide as his personal views would indicate. Subsequently Mr.
R. L. Richardson, M.P. for Richmond, Manitoba, moved a resolution
demanding that no titular honors of any kind be granted thereafter. This
was defeated on the Prime Minister declaring it to be a
want-of-confidence motion. On this motion Mr. Nickle was placed in the
peculiar position of having to abandon the Government or his personal
convictions, but decided to stick by conviction. Another broad principle
that was discussed as a result of Mr. Nickle’s original motion was
whether the Government of Canada should not be consulted before titular
distinctions were conferred by the Crown on Canadians resident in this
country. The Prime Minister, Sir Robert Borden, announced that he had
accepted this principle, except in connection with military honors, so
that Mr. Nickle may be regarded as having materially aided in checking
an abuse which was becoming a cause of public unrest, by precipitating
discussion of the matter.

Is Rector of St. Paul’s Church, Toronto, and Archdeacon of York, and
Canon of St. Alban’s Cathedral. Was elected Bishop of Nova Scotia, but
declined the preferment in 1904. Was a member of the Royal Commission on
the reorganization of The University of Toronto, 1905-6, and a member of
The Ontario Commission on Unemployment, 1914-15. One of the founders of
Havergal Ladies’ College, Toronto. In May, 1918, on the resignation of
the Hon. Dr. R. A. Pyne as Minister of Education of Ontario, Dr. Cody
was invited by Premier Hearst to assume the duties of that most
important portfolio and, on May 23, he was sworn in as Minister of
Education of the Province and at once took up his duties, and was
subsequently nominated for the riding of North East Toronto. His
election was opposed by Sergt. William Varley, a popular soldier, who
had distinguished himself overseas on active service. Dr. Cody was
returned by a very large majority. The Minister of Education has special
gifts for the office he has been called upon to fill. His wide learning
and eminence as a scholar, his tireless energy and organizing ability,
caused his selection to be acceptable by all classes and few Canadians
occupy a more secure place in the confidence, respect and esteem of
their fellows. Splendidly informed in all great National questions and a
brilliant orator, his services have been in constant demand. Shortly
after assuming the duties of his present position, the Minister, at the
request of the Premier, made a trip overseas and visited the soldiers in
the firing line for the express purpose of familiarizing himself with
the conditions existing at the front, with a view to make his Department

=Roadhouse, William Albert=, Deputy Minister of Agriculture for the
Province of Ontario, was born at Malton, Peel County, Ontario, July 25,
1880, the son of Neriah and Elizabeth Roadhouse. He was educated at the
Malton and Brampton public schools and on leaving school became—what so
many men afterwards famous in many fields of activity have been—“A
printer’s devil” in the office of the Brampton “Conservator,” where he
spent six years under Samuel Charters, now member of the House of
Commons for Peel. While working in the printing department he also wrote
local items and on leaving the “Conservator,” took up newspaper work,
joining the staff of the “Evening Telegram” in 1902. While with that
paper he represented it in the Legislative Press Gallery. Subsequently
he spent a year in London, England, as correspondent of the Canadian
Associated Press, “covering” the general election in Britain in 1905-6
for the Canadian papers. On his return to Canada he rejoined the
“Evening Telegram” staff and continued as a member of it till June 1,
1909, when he was appointed Secretary to the Minister and Department of
Agriculture. During the same year he served as Secretary to the Ontario
Government Milk Commission. On the retirement of the late C. C. James,
LL.D., from the position of Deputy Minister, March 1, 1912, Mr.
Roadhouse was promoted to his present position—being probably the
youngest man ever appointed a Deputy Minister in the Province of
Ontario. He has made many addresses and contributed numerous articles to
the press on the subjects with which he is specially familiar. He
married, July 3, 1912, Lillian Maud Wyndow, daughter of Wm. Wyndow,
Toronto. He is a Protestant and a member of the A.F. & A.M. In his
dealings with the public, Mr. Roadhouse is extremely courteous while in
the conduct of his department, his guiding idea seems to be clear cut
thinking and practical action. His address is Parliament Bldgs.,
Toronto.

=Baillie, Sir Frank, K.B.E.= (Toronto), one of the most eminent of the
younger generation of Canadian business men, and who rendered very
important service in the matter of munition production during the great
war, was born at Toronto on August 19, 1875. He is the son of John and
Marian (Wilton) Baillie, and was educated in his native city. He
commenced his business career as a clerk in the offices of the Central
Canada Loan and Savings Company, Toronto, and later became private
secretary to the eminent capitalist, the late Senator George A. Cox, in
which capacity he obtained a very close insight into modern methods of
business organization. In 1896 he was appointed accountant of the
Central Canada Loan and Savings Company, and was successively promoted
to Secretary (1898) and Assistant Manager (1901) of the same
corporation. In 1902 he became General Manager of the newly incorporated
Metropolitan Bank, being probably the youngest man ever placed in full
managerial control of a chartered bank in the history of this country.
In 1903 he founded the firm of Baillie, Wood & Croft, stock brokers, and
members of the Toronto Stock Exchange. His position as an industrial
leader began in 1910 with the organization of the Burlington Steel
Company of Hamilton, Ont., of which he is still President. In 1912 he
organized the Bankers Bond Company, Limited, Toronto, and in the same
year the Dominion Steel Foundry Company of Hamilton, Ont. Shortly after
the commencement of the European War in 1914 he organized the Canadian
Cartridge Co., Ltd., of Hamilton, of which he is President, to undertake
the much needed work of manufacturing cartridge cases for the British
Government. He personally equipped himself with knowledge of the
technical work of munition making and so successful did he prove as an
industrial organizer that he was able within two years to return to the
British Government over $750,000 profits earned from war contracts, as a
patriotic gift. Subsequently the Canadian Cartridge Company engaged in
the manufacture of anti-aircraft cases for the United States Government
on a large scale. In December, 1916, Sir Frank was appointed Director of
Aviation for Canada, and in the same month acting for the British
Government, organized and became President of Canadian Aeroplanes,
Limited, which corporation manufactured aeroplanes for the Royal Air
Force in Canada and flying boats for the American Government. On January
9, 1918, shortly after the institution by His Majesty of the Order of
the British Empire, to honor those who had rendered distinguished
service in the prosecution of the war, the subject of this sketch was
created a Knight Commander of that Order. Sir Frank is essentially an
outdoor man and his recreations include golf, motoring, curling and
yachting. He is a member of the following clubs: National, Toronto,
Albany, Lambton Golf and Country, Mississauga Golf and Royal Canadian
Yacht Club, Toronto; Victoria Club, Hamilton, and Hamilton Golf,
Hamilton. In politics he is independent and in religion an Anglican. On
June 8, 1900, he married Edith Julia, daughter of the late Aubrey White,
C.M.G., for many years Deputy Minister of Lands and Mines for Ontario.
He has three sons, Aubrey Wilton, born July 6, 1908, Frank Wilton, born
November 4, 1913, and James Wilton, born December 1, 1918; and two
daughters, Marion Wilton, born April 23, 1901, and Edith Wilton, born

member of the Ontario bar, and prominent in the commercial and social

=Workman, Mark= (Montreal, Que.), was born in Buffalo, N.Y., on August
4, 1864, the son of Isaac and Sarah (Rosenthal) Workman. He received his
education in the public schools, and came to Montreal with his father in
1876, joining with him in the clothing business. The lad became the head
of the business in 1880, at the remarkably youthful age of sixteen
years. With unusual business instinct and untiring industry, the young
Workman piloted his enterprise along the course of steady growth until,
in 1906, the company of which he remained head was incorporated, and
expanded until its travellers covered the whole of Canada, from Atlantic
to Pacific. For nearly twenty years now (1917) the Mark Workman Company
has been contractors for the British and Canadian Governments for
military clothing, and has been responsible for many enormous contracts
during the present war. Beyond the confines of his own business, Mr.
Workman also found scope for his enterprise and ability. He interested
himself extensively in Canadian industry, notably the Dominion Steel
Corporation, of which he is one of the largest shareholders and was
elected President in 1916. Endowed with foresight and courage,
attributes which helped to raise him to his enviable position in the
business world, he believed that the formation of the Dominion Iron and
Steel Company, with its adjunct, the Dominion Coal Company, would not
only open the way for a gigantic steel enterprise in Canada which would
take care of the big domestic business in the Dominion, but also extend
to other parts of the Empire and to foreign countries. He believed in
the future of the undertaking, invested money in it, fought it
successfully through the dark days of its early experience, and won out.
In 1911 he became a director of the Corporation, and his active interest
in the management resulted in his being made chairman of the finance and
selling committees of the directorate. Mr. Workman is also the
Vice-President of the Federal Parquetry Company, of Lexington, Ky.;
vice-president of the Jacobs Asbestos Company, Ltd., of Thetford Mines,
Que., and is interested in the B. Gardner Company, of Montreal. While
the success that came to Mr. Workman brought him great wealth and
influence, his business activities did not prevent a generous and
personal interest in many charitable works, his yearly benefactions to
worthy causes and individuals being estimated at fifty to sixty thousand
dollars. He is a life Governor of the Montreal General Hospital and
other hospitals and charitable institutions, to the funds of which he is
a liberal contributor. He has given most generously to the Patriotic
Fund and to the various regimental funds, and was a subscriber to the
extent of $200,000 to the Canadian War Loan. Mr. Workman is also
prominent in philanthropic work among the Jewish population of Canada
and is president and actual upbuilder of the Mount Sinai Sanatorium for
fighting the white plague. A sample of his deep interest in the race was
his remarkable response to the appeal of Mr. Leopold Rothschild since
the outbreak of the war on behalf of Jewish sufferers in Russia. Mr.
Workman forwarded an immediate cash contribution of $5,000, with an
appended offer to supplement that gift by the subscription of $1,000 per
month. Mr. Workman married, when twenty years of age, Miss Rachel Lewis,
of Syracuse, N.Y., on February 18, 1886. He has one son, Edward, a
Lieut. in the Canadian overseas army, and four daughters, Mrs. Nathan
Gordon, of Montreal; Mrs. Harry Rosenthal, of Ottawa, and the Misses
Nina and Daisy Workman. He is a member of the Masonic and the Royal
Guardians.

=Pennington, David Henry=, one of the prominent lumber merchants of
Quebec City, formerly a member of the Legislative Assembly, and later a
member of the Harbor Commission of Quebec, was born in that city on
February the 14th, 1868. He is a son of William Pennington of Preston,
England, who for many years lived at Montmorency Falls, while engaged in
the office of the G. B. Hall Lumber Company. Entering as a junior clerk
of that company, the subject of this sketch worked his way up to the
post of general manager of the Company’s branch of operations in the
Eastern Townships. Eventually buying out the interests of the Company in
the Townships, he established himself at Lyster, there possessing two
saw-mills, a large dressing lumber mill, and a pulpwood storing station.
His business activities were soon felt in the community, making it, as
they did, an important business outlet on the Grand Trunk Railway route
between Quebec and Richmond, for the adjacent counties of Lotbinière and
Megantic. During the twelve years he resided at Lyster he was Mayor of
the place for nine of them, besides being Warden of the County of
Megantic. In 1908 he was elected to represent that county in the Local
Legislature at Quebec, where his intimate knowledge of French as well as
English, won an influence for him at once. In 1912 he sold his
properties at Lyster, and returned to Quebec, there to continue his
successful career as a lumber merchant. During these years there has
passed through his hands an annual output of from sixty to seventy
thousand cords of pulpwood alone. He was among the first to export
pulpwood to the United States, and was one of the promoters of the
Wayagamack Pulp and Paper Company of Three Rivers. He has been largely
interested for years in the asbestos industry in the Thetford Mining
district, and has a large business interest in timber limits on and near
the Lower St. Lawrence. As a public-spirited citizen he takes high rank,
having in 1916 been appointed by the Federal Government at Ottawa to the
highly responsible position of one of the three Harbor Commissioners of
his native city. He has given two of his sons to the Service of the
Empire, his eldest, Lieut. Ronald N. Pennington and his younger brother
Frank, having distinguished themselves with Canada’s “bravest” at the
front. Mr. Pennington has been married twice, first to Miss S. E. Neil,
the mother of the two lads just mentioned; and, second, Miss Mary S.
Stewart, the daughter of the late Duncan Stewart of Inverness. By the
latter he has one son and one daughter. Mr. Pennington’s mother was born
in St. John’s, Newfoundland. He is a Warden of the Anglican Cathedral
and a member of the Board of Trade, being prominent in all the public
and patriotic movements of the city.

=Peuchen, Lieut.-Col. Arthur Godfrey=, Capitalist, retired Manufacturer,
son of Godfrey E. Peuchen and Eliza Eleanor Clarke of Hull, Eng. born in
Montreal, April 18, 1859; educated in private schools there. His father
was a Railroad Contractor in South America and built a railroad from
Laguero to Caracas, Venezuela; his grandfather was manager of the
London, Brighton and Midland Railway in England. Canada is indebted to
Col. Peuchen for his ingenuity in being the first man to grasp the
possibility of utilizing the unmarketable portions of our hardwood
forests in a scientific way. In travelling he observed that England and
France had virtually no forests, and knowing that the Canadian lumberman
was only taking from our woods the flotable timber, leaving the
unmerchantable coarse hardwood, he conceived the idea of turning this
waste into the manufacturing of valuable chemicals: Acetic Acid, Acetate
of Lime, Acetone, Wood Alcohol and Formaldehyde, the latter being so
important for the successful growing of wheat in Canada, and the former
for the dyeing industry; also benefited the English War Office by being
the first man under the British Flag to produce acetone direct from
wood, which he supplied the Admiralty in large quantities for the
manufacture of high explosives, such as cordite. Introduced our present
system of charcoal distribution in paper bags. With Sir Wm. McKenzie and
others he organized the Standard Chemical Company with a small capital,
which he gradually through his unbounded energy increased to five
millions—beginning in 1897 by distilling only 22 tons of wood per day,
eventually by 1913 this distillation was increased to over 1,000 tons.
The production of these chemicals meant a tremendous export trade. He
erected factories at: Fenelon Falls, Deseronto, Longford Mills, South
River, Sault Ste. Marie, Fassett and Cookshire, and operated factories
at Thornbury, Parry Sound and Mount Tremblant; erected refineries in
Montreal, London, England, France and Germany, where crude alcohol was
shipped and refined; bought and operated blast charcoal furnaces at
Deseronto, and built one at Parry Sound. Was President and General
Manager of the Standard Chemical Company from 1897 to 1914. Was active
in military circles: Lt., Q.O.R., 1888; Captain, 1894; Major, 1904;
Lieutenant-Colonel, May 21st, 1912. Went to England with the Queen’s Own
in 1910 as Major, for the Imperial Fall Manœuvres at Salisbury Plain,
and part of this period was in charge of the regiment under General
French. Was Marshalling Officer in command of escort of officers of
Indian Cavalry, Royal Procession, Coronation of King George, 1911;
Officer Commanding Home Battalion Q.O.R., 1914 and 1915. Officer’s long

of two only surviving males in Canada. President of the Imperial Land

which crossed the Atlantic under her own canvas and won more races in
her class than any other yacht in Canada. Member of St. Paul’s Anglican
Church and a Governor of Grace Hospital. In politics a Conservative.

=Birkett, Thomas=, was born in Bytown (now Ottawa), February 1, 1844. He
is the son of Miles and Elizabeth (Wren) Birkett, who came to Canada
from Cumberland, England, in 1838, and who saw that he received a good
education at the Public and Grammar Schools, and that he was thoroughly
prepared for commercial business life. That their efforts were not in
vain was shown at an early date, in the rapid and successful progress
that greeted his efforts and ventures. But, and in addition, they had
the good fortune to see their son make his mark in School, Municipal,
Provincial and Dominion and other public affairs and to be elected to
many public offices of trust where he distinguished himself in various
ways and established an enviable record for progressive, reliable and
lasting service. In every public office, to which he was elected he
devoted the attention and care that was made so evident and pronounced
in his private business with the result that he not only made good, but
cemented and enlarged the confidence and esteem of those who had
selected him as their representative. Whether as director or trustee of
a public institution, as member of the city council, mayor of the city,
or as member of Parliament, his conduct was the same and the result the
same, viz., conscientious devotion to duty attended by successful
results. Many a time it has been proclaimed, even by those who were
politically opposed to him, that having rendered to the State the
continuous and valuable public services that he did, and in a manner so
effective, that he would long ago have been called to the Canadian
Senate, and great has been the surprise that he has not been. But being
still robust in health, mentally and physically, and his activities
being as marked as they were in former years, it may not be out of place
to say that a seat in the Senate will be honored by his presence at an
early date. Having served as an apprentice in the hardware trade to Mr.
Isaac, in 1866, Mr. Birkett opened a retail hardware store on Rideau
Street, prospered, and soon had to remove to larger premises. For thirty
years he kept in the retail business, which year by year assumed larger
proportions and supplied goods to the many prosperous and wealthy
manufacturing towns and villages and thriving agricultural districts in
the Ottawa Valley. Finding the demand for his goods still on the
increase in 1896 he converted his private firm into a joint stock
company, of which he became president, his son Thomas M. Birkett,
vice-president, and other members of the family shareholders, and
launched into the wholesale business under the title of Thomas Birkett &
Son Company, Limited, of Ottawa. To-day this wholesale firm is one of
the most extensive, if not actually the largest hardware house in
Eastern Ontario and is known from one end of Canada to the other. The
building forms one of the best business blocks in Ottawa and is most
advantageously situated, the warehouse doors opening direct on the
wharves of the Rideau Canal basin. Mr. Birkett served as School Trustee
from 1869 to 1873; as Alderman, from 1873 to 1878; as Mayor, during 1891

=Anderson, Alexander James= (Toronto, Ont.), was born in Adelaide
Township, Middlesex County, July 1, 1863, and was educated at Strathroy
High School and Osgoode Hall. Toronto is as famous for its Bar as it is
in its commercial and manufacturing industry, and in alluding to its
leading members, prominent mention must be made of the subject of this
sketch. Mr. Anderson started his professional career with J. S.
Fullerton & Co., which partnership continued from 1891 to 1897; from
1894 to 1906 he practised alone; from 1907 to 1909 was a member of the
firm of Anderson & Gray, and entered his present partnership as senior
member of the firm (Anderson & McMaster) in 1910. Having municipal
aspirations, Mr. Anderson was elected to the Council of Toronto Junction
from 1899 to 1902; was corporation solicitor for West Toronto until the
amalgamation with the city in 1909, when he was elected alderman to
represent Ward Seven in the City Council. He was for four years a member
of the West Toronto School Board, and was elected Chairman of that body
in 1899. During the elections in 1904 he was unanimously selected by the
Liberals of South York as the party standard bearer, and though defeated
he made a very creditable showing at the close of the polls. Mr.
Anderson has many warm friends and supporters in the western portion of
the city, and he will show unexpected strength should he again become a
candidate. He is a Mason and takes an active interest in the welfare of
the Order.

=Barnard, Hon. George Henry, K.C.=, Member of the Senate of Canada
(Victoria, B.C.), is a son of Francis Jones Barnard, a Canadian who went
to British Columbia from Ontario, when gold was first discovered in the
Fraser River, in 1859, and shortly afterwards became the founder of the
stage and express line from Yale, head of navigation on the Fraser, to
Barkerville, 400 miles to the north. On the famous Yale-Cariboo Road the
elder Barnard long operated a line of stages and carried the mail to the
mountain settlements of the district. The maiden name of the mother of
the subject of this sketch was Ellen Hillman, and he was born at
Victoria, B.C., Oct. 9, 1868. Sir Frank S. Barnard, K.C.M.G.,
Lieut.-Governor of British Columbia, is a brother. He was educated at
Trinity College School, Port Hope, and qualified for the law, entering
practice at Victoria. He was appointed King’s Counsel on Dec. 24, 1907.
Senator Barnard took an active interest in municipal affairs and served
as Alderman, 1902-3. In 1904 he was elected Mayor of Victoria and
continued in office for two years. He was first elected to the House of
Commons for that city at the general elections of 1908, as a
Conservative and was re-elected in 1911. On Oct. 23, 1917, he was
elevated to the Senate of Canada by the newly-formed Union Government of
Sir Robert Borden. Senator Barnard is a prominent social figure both at
Victoria and Ottawa, and is a member of the Union Club, Victoria, the
Vancouver Club, the Rideau Club, Ottawa and the Constitutional Club,

=Gariepy, Wilfrid, B.A., B.C.L., K.C., M.L.A.= (Edmonton, Alberta), was
born at Montreal, P.Q., on March 14, 1877. He is the son of Joseph H.
Gariepy, for many years a pioneer and leading merchant in the city of
Edmonton, an alderman and school trustee, and, by the way, a native of
St. Lin, P.Q., where was also born Sir Wilfrid Laurier. In days gone by
the Gariepys and the Lauriers intermingled considerably and Sir Wilfrid
when a boy attended the parish common school along with the grandfather
of the hero of this sketch. It was only natural that our subject should
at his birth be christened after the renowned Liberal Leader, who in
1877 was already in the political limelight. Four generations of
Gariepys were born and lived on the same homestead at St. Lin, three
miles from the parochial church. The mother of Mr. Wilfrid Gariepy,
Etudienne Boissonneault, who is yet living and residing in Edmonton, as
well as her husband, is a daughter of Noel Boissonneault, one of the
founders of the Town of Morinville, Alberta, as he came from the
Province of Quebec with the first contingent of colonists brought west
in 1891 by the late Father J. B. Morin, one of the most enthusiastic
colonization agents of his day. Noel Boissonneault was at one time a
leading Liberal politician in the Eastern Townships and for some years
was the moving spirit of the St. Onge Gold Mining Company, which did
business on the Gilbert River in Beauce County, P.Q. A maternal ancestor
of our subject was among the French-Canadian soldiers who fought for the
British Crown in 1812. On the other hand it is worth noting that another
figured in the uprising of 1837-1838, in favor of constitutional
government, on the shores of the St. Lawrence. Mr. Wilfrid Gariepy was
educated at the Sisters of Providence Academy, “Le jardin de l’enfance,”
on St. Denis Street, in Montreal, beginning in September, 1881; at Notre
Dame College, Côte des Neiges, Montreal, where he spent two years; at
St. Laurent’s College with the Fathers of the Holy Cross, remaining
there until January, 1891, when ill-health compelled him to abandon his
classical studies. He was then in the middle of versification. Deciding
to turn his activities into other channels, he attended the Montreal
Business College for some months and afterwards became a clerk in his
father’s store: first, in general groceries on St. Paul Street,
Montreal, and later in Edmonton, on Jasper Avenue, to which town the
family moved in March, 1893. In Montreal, although very young, Mr. W.
Gariepy indicated his political tastes by being one of the active
members of the “Club Letellier,” one of the oldest Liberal
organizations, and also by taking a hand in a mayoralty campaign in
favor of the Hon. James McShane, the famous “people’s Jimmy,” and by
working for the Hon. Honoré Mercier and his candidates after the famous
“renvoi d’office.” In 1893 Edmonton had just become a town, with a
population of less than 1,000, no modern conveniences, with the
exception of a rudimentary telephone and electric light system. Needless
to say, streets were unpaved and there were not even any sidewalks.
Still the town had a Mock Parliament, and we find our subject a member
of it, with a portfolio in its government. Mr. W. Gariepy was elected
one of the secretaries of the Liberal Club and also became, in 1894, at
its foundation, secretary to the Société de St. Jean Baptiste of
Edmonton. In 1895, with the Hon. Frank Oliver, who had just been
selected as Liberal candidate of Alberta, Mr. W. Gariepy made a tour
north of Edmonton, during which he addressed several meetings. It was in
September, 1895, that Mr. Gariepy found his health and other
circumstances such that he was able to return to the St. Laurent College
to complete his classical course. He stayed in that institution until
June, 1897, during which period he for one year filled the presidency of
the Literary Academy of the college. In the rhetoric bacheloriate on
papers submitted by Laval University, Mr. Gariepy succeeded with great
honors. He next went to the Seminary of Philosophy with the Sulpician
Fathers, to follow a two years’ course in philosophy, which gave him the
degree of Bachelor of Arts of Laval University. He chose the profession
of law and became articled in Montreal to Mr. Matthew Hutchinson, now a
judge of the Superior Court, in Sherbrooke. P.Q., with whom he remained
for three years, in the meantime following the law lectures at McGill
University, from which institution he received, in April, 1902, the
degree of Bachelor of Civil Law. In 1901 Mr. Gariepy had the honor of
being selected by the McGill Faculty of Law to represent it at the Laval
Law Students’ Banquet, at the city of Quebec.

In the federal and provincial campaigns in 1900, Mr. W. Gariepy for
several months addressed meetings, spending the bulk of his time in the
constituency of Terrebonne, at the request of the late Honorables
Raymond Prefontaine and Jean Prévost. At that period, at the formation
of a Liberal Students’ Association in Montreal, he was elected its
Secretary, while the Vice-President thereof was Walter Mitchell, the
present Provincial Treasurer of Quebec. Having been admitted to the Bar
of the Province of Quebec in January, 1903, Mr. Gariepy immediately
secured his enrolment in the Bar of the North-West Territories and
opened an office in Edmonton on the same spot where years before he had
been carrying on work as a clerk in his father’s store. In the following
May a by-election having been called to elect a member for the
constituency of St. Albert, in the North-West Territories Legislature,
at a convention, Mr. Gariepy accepted the nomination but for personal
reasons subsequently withdrew from the contest. For three years Mr.
Gariepy was a member of the law firm of Taylor, Boyle and Gariepy, the
senior member being Judge H. C. Taylor, of Edmonton District, and the
other member, the Hon. J. R. Boyle, now Minister of Education in the
Alberta Government. From 1907 to 1911, Mr. Gariepy was a member of the
law firm of Gariepy & Landry, his partner being Mr. Hector Landry, son
of the late Sir Pierre Landry, of New Brunswick. Mr. Gariepy is now the
senior member of the firm of Gariepy, Dunlop & Pratt. This firm is among
the leading firms of the City of Edmonton, and while his present
political activities prevent our subject from devoting much time to law,
he has always paid great attention to his law practice. He has had the
distinction of figuring as leading counsel in two murder cases—one, the
Gladu Brothers, who were acquitted, and the other the Barrett case, that
life convict who was condemned to capital punishment after having been
convicted of wilfully killing with an axe, Deputy-Governor Stedman, of
the Edmonton Penitentiary. For six years Mr. Gariepy was a member of the
Separate School Board of Edmonton, being chairman of the commission for
two years. It was under his chairmanship that the Separate School on
Third Street was erected. In December, 1906, he was elected an alderman
of the city of Edmonton, and although running for the first time in the
city at large, as there are no wards, he came second on the list, the
first one beating him only by one vote. Two years later Mr. W. Gariepy
was re-elected, this time at the head of the list, having some 300 more
votes than the next man. While an alderman he held the chairmanship of
several important committees and was delegated on two occasions: first,
to Chicago with ex-Mayor J. A. McDougall, to inspect the automatic
telephone system, which was eventually to be installed in Edmonton; and,
second, to Ottawa with ex-Mayor Lee, to interview the Dominion
Government respecting the Dominion’s contribution towards the
construction of the C.P.R. high-level bridge between Strathcona and
Edmonton. It was during Mr. Gariepy’s term of office that the Edmonton
automatic telephone system was installed; that the street railway system
was completed and put in operation; and that the C.P.R high-level bridge
was completed and opened for traffic; and that negotiations for the
amalgamation of Edmonton and Strathcona were begun. In 1910 Mr. Gariepy
was chairman of the civic committee that organized such a splendid
reception as was tendered to Sir Wilfrid Laurier, then Prime Minister,
on the occasion of his visit to the Capital of Alberta, and it was at
that time that Mr. Gariepy secured the adoption of a resolution by the
city council giving to a park the name of “Laurier Park.” Mr. Gariepy
took a leading part in the federal campaigns of 1904, 1908 and 1911. In
1909 he was the unsuccessful Liberal candidate in the provincial
constituency of St. Albert, his successful opponent being also a
Liberal, as there was no Conservative candidate running. In 1911 he was
elected Grand Knight of the Edmonton Council of the Knights of Columbus;
in 1907 he was elected president of the Edmonton Société de St. Jean
Baptiste; in 1912 he was elected vice-president of the French-Canadian
Alberta Convention, held in Edmonton, and by that convention was elected
as the only delegate to represent it at the French-Canadian Congress
held that year in the city of Quebec; in 1913 he was elected president
of the Society du Parler-Français of Alberta, and as such presided over
the French-Canadian congress of Alberta, held at Edmonton in 1914. On
September 9, 1903, Mr. Wilfrid Gariepy married Albertina Lessard,
daughter of Jean P. Lessard and Annie Davidson, of Cranbourne, P.Q., a
sister of the Hon. P. E. Lessard, M.L.A., for St. Paul, and a former
business partner of Mr. J. H. Gariepy. We may note that Mr. P. E.
Lessard had previously married Miss Hélène Gariepy, the eldest sister of
our subject. From the marriage of Mr. W. Gariepy with Miss Lessard have
been born four children: Hormidas, Marcelle, Wilfrid and George. Mr.
Gariepy is a member of the Y.M.C.A. and a lieutenant in the 101st
Edmonton Fusiliers. In 1912 he was elected as president of the Edmonton
Liberal Association; on March 17, 1913, he was elected a member of the
legislature for Beaver River. At the first session of that parliament,
in the following September, he was chosen to make the speech in moving
the adoption of the Speech from the Throne. On November 28, 1913, he was
sworn in as Minister of Municipal Affairs, becoming a member of the
administration headed by the Hon. Arthur L. Sifton. On December 15,
1913, Mr. Gariepy was re-elected for Beaver River, by acclamation. On
December 22, 1913, at the Cecil Hotel, as a compliment on his becoming a
member of the government, his French-Canadian compatriots, numbering
some four hundred, tendered him a banquet. In September, 1915, Mr.
Gariepy represented, with the Hon. Mr. Sifton, the Province of Alberta
at a national tax conference held in San Francisco, California. In
March, 1913, Mr. Gariepy was made a King’s Counsel for the Province of
Alberta. In August, 1915, the same honor was conferred on him by the
Province of Quebec. At the date of writing this biography, Mr. Gariepy
has been for over five years a member of the Alberta Government and his
friends predict that he has yet a long public career to fulfil. As
Minister of Municipal Affairs for Alberta Mr. Gariepy has been
responsible for the introduction of legislation which has been a
landmark in the western provinces, namely: The Wild Lands Tax Act and
the Municipal Hospitals Act.

rose to his present responsible position with a reputation as one of the
leading authorities in Canada on all questions relating to the fishing
industry. Leonard Fisheries, which started business in 1875, and is now
one of the leading concerns in its line, was incorporated under its
present form in 1917, as a result of the consolidation Leonard Bros.,

=Harper, John Murdoch= (Quebec City), the Canadian educationist and
author, came to Canada in the year of Confederation, 1867, to take
charge of an Academy in New Brunswick. He was born in Johnstone,
Renfrewshire, Scotland, on the 10th of February, 1845, the eldest son of
Robert Montgomery Harper, the founder of the first newspaper published
in that town. His grand-uncle was Robert Montgomery, who was for many
years a mill-owner and manufacturer in Johnstone. From school he entered
the Glasgow E. C. Training College, after taking a Queen’s Scholarship,
and graduated as a teacher from it with the highest certificate of his
year granted by the Lords of the Council of Education, London, and with
special certificates from the Science and Art Department, Kensington.
After coming to Canada he became a graduate of Queen’s University,
Kingston, and thereafter received the degree of Doctor of Philosophy,
from the Illinois University, after completing the three years’
post-graduate course in the section of metaphysical science. In 1881 he
was unanimously elected a Fellow of the Educational Institute of
Scotland, an honor seldom conferred on teachers laboring outside of
Great Britain. For a time he acted as principal of the Model Schools of
Nova Scotia, and afterwards as principal of the Victoria High School of
St. John, New Brunswick. While there he was asked by the Premier of
Prince Edward Island to become Superintendent of Education in that
province, which he declined to accept. But when the Victoria School
buildings were destroyed in the great fire of St. John, he was induced
to accept the principalship of the Provincial Normal School in
Charlottetown and the Supervisorship of the City Schools, while St. John
and its school buildings were being rebuilt. At the end of three years
spent in inaugurating the new system of schools in Prince Edward Island,
he was invited, in face of his inclination to return to his former
position in New Brunswick, to take charge of the Quebec High School as
its Rector; and, accepting the appointment, he thus became identified
with the educational interests of the Province of Quebec, where he has
labored ever since, closing his career as an educationist in active
service as Inspector of the Protestant Superior Schools of that
province. While holding that office he entered upon his vocation as an
author, having been for many years editor-in-chief of the “Educational
Record,” a contributor to the “Educational Monthly” of Ontario, the
“Queen’s Quarterly,” and other periodicals, besides being associated
with Dr. Thomas Morison, of Glasgow, one of the most distinguished of
the educationists of Scotland, in the compilation of sundry text-books.
His earlier essays and addresses on “The New Education,” and “Cause and
Effect in School Work,” led to his issue of “A Manual on Moral Drill,”
in line with his pleadings for an educative “Mental and Physical Drill”
in the schools of the day. His plan for a definite moral training is
thus spoken of by a New York educationist and author of high standing:
“Dr. Harper’s work is entirely original. It is sound. It is eminently
practical and it should be most heartily adopted by all who have the
training of the young in hand, and who earnestly desire that the rising
generation may develop into a ‘coming race,’ in whom moral rectitude
will be natural and spontaneous.” As an author, Dr. Harper has had a
career as full of the best kind of literary work, as has been his career
as an educationist in advice with his co-workers in school progress
throughout Canada. The list of the books he has written is all but
incredibly large. His _chef-d’ouvre_ is unquestionably his drama of
“Champlain,” which has given him rank, as one critic says, as the
greatest of our Canadian dramatic poets since the days of Heavysege. The
late George Murray, of Montreal, a writer of just discrimination,
claimed that Dr. Harper is one of the most versatile and prolific of
Canadian litterateurs. A partial list of his literary output from year
to year includes the following: “The Development of the Greek Drama,”
“The Chronicles of Kartdale,” “Sacrament Sunday and the Bells of
Kartdale,” “The Earliest Beginnings of Canada,” “The Montgomery Siege,”
“The Little Sergeant,” “The Seer of Silver Lake,” “_Domini Domus_, or
the Chateau St. Louis,” “The Songs of the Commonwealth,” and “A Guide to
Good Will in the Empire.” Three uniformly bound volumes of his series of
“Studies in Verse and Prose,” have so far appeared, including “The
Battle of the Plains,” and “The Annals of the War,” supplementary to his
“Champlain, a Drama.” With the influence of his earlier years clinging
to him, he has not failed to produce many pieces that depict the scenes
of the land of his birth; and his poetic status as a versifier in the
Doric of the Scottish Lowlands has been duly recognized by Dr. John D.
Ross in his volume on “The Scottish Poets in America,” as well as by the
gifted author of the book entitled “The Scot in America.” Dr. Ross pays
a high tribute to the author of “Sacrament Sunday,” “Saint Andrew’s
Day,” “The Old Graveyard,” “Auld Jeames and His Crack,” “Horace in the
Doric,” and others of Dr. Harper’s Scottish odes, in such words as
these: “Sweet as the note of a bird in the wildwood, strongly embued
with patriotism, fervent in religious sentiment, eloquent in thought,
pure in expression, and noble in purpose, form a few of the
characteristics of Dr. Harper, the Canadian educationist and author.” In
addition to all this, Dr. Harper is a loyal Canadian. In all his public
utterances and in the pleadings of his prolific authorship in book or
magazine or newspaper, he is a Canadian citizen who upholds as a British
subject the ample patriotism of the British Empire. He has been twice
married, his first wife’s maiden name having been Miss Agnes Kirkwood,
daughter of William Kirkwood of Stanley Muir, near Paisley, and his
second, Miss Elizabeth Hastings, daughter of Andrew Hastings, of St.
John and step-daughter of William Nossack, a former Mayor of Quebec. His
family has comprised two sons and five daughters. His grandson, Major
John Harper Evans, has been a soldier at the front, after his training
at the Kingston Royal Military College.

=Brennan, John Charles.= In 1854, when but a boy, when Ottawa (then
By-Town) had only some 7,000 inhabitants, when the old Ottawa and St.
Lawrence Railway was just built—the only line of railway connecting
Ottawa with other towns at that time—when houses were few and far
between and when there was no prospect of the place being selected by
Her Most Gracious Majesty the late Queen Victoria as the Capital of the
Dominion of Canada, the subject of this sketch became a member of the
wholesale grocery firm of S. Howell & Co., with which he remained for
twenty-seven years, retiring from business in 1881. While giving his
untiring care to the affairs of the firm, and by his energy and business
tact adding in a marked degree to its advancement—its commercial and
financial success—Mr. Brennan, with full confidence in the future that
he perceived was in store for Ottawa, never lost an opportunity to place
his time, ambition and money in channels leading to its improvement and,
with other enterprising citizens, exerted his every endeavor to
stimulate its growth and importance. To-day, with marked pride, he sees
the seven thousand population increased to one hundred and twenty
thousand, the once fields and uncared-for lanes converted into
beautifully paved streets, parks, and gardens, the costly Parliament
Buildings, standing in all their grandeur upon the hill overlooking the
Ottawa River; huge commercial, financial and office buildings and
apartment houses galore facing the eye at every angle, and handsome
modern residences in abundance. Aside from his other real estate
holdings, Mr. Brennan, on the corner of Bank and Queen Streets, in the
very midst of the Capital’s commercial and financial activities, has
placed that large and solidly-constructed office building, “The
Trafalgar.” Mr. Brennan has ever taken a keen interest in Ottawa’s
hospitals, charitable institutions, churches, etc., and has unstintingly
contributed to their support. Whenever called upon to help advance their
interests he has freely contributed his quota, and more. During the
great war, his moral, physical, intellectual and financial aid have ever
been given to promote the successful operations of the Government, and
to afford the war workers, the boys at the front and the returned
soldiers, material help. Mr. Brennan has grown up with the city and
together both he and it have prospered. Although solicited on many
occasions to enter into public life he has steadfastly refused, being
satisfied in his private capacity as a citizen to do his share in making
general progress his goal. Mr. John Charles Brennan was born at
Frankville, Ontario, January 23, 1839. He is the son of John and Amelia
Maria (Howell) Brennan; he was educated in the Public Schools and
private tuition. June 5, 1899, he married Alice Maud Wilson, daughter of
Zachariah Wilson of “Clandeboye,” late Collector of Customs at the Port
of Ottawa. He has one son and two daughters—John Charles, Amelia
Elizabeth and Jocelyn Maud Wilson. He is a member of the Ottawa Hunt,
Connaught Park Jockey, the Gatineau Fish and Game, and the Rideau Fish
and Game Clubs. For recreation he indulges in hunting, fishing and
travelling. In politics he is a Conservative, in religion a Methodist,
and his place of residence is 150 Cooper Street, Ottawa.

=Bulman, William John= (Winnipeg, Man.), one of the most prominent and
progressive business men of Manitoba, was born at Toronto on April 5,
1870, the son of William and Frances (Cable) Bulman. He was educated in
the Toronto Public Schools and, on leaving school at the age of sixteen,
learned the art of the lithographer, in which he was employed in his
native city for six years. In 1892 he went to Winnipeg and founded the
business of Bulman Bros., Ltd., Lithographers, of which he is President
and which is one of the most important firms of its kind in Canada. In
promoting the advancement of Winnipeg he has been indefatigable. He was
one of the founders of the Winnipeg Industrial Bureau, and was its
President from 1911 to 1913. He was Hon. Secretary of the Manitoba
branch of the Canadian Manufacturers’ Association for some years and
subsequently became 2nd Vice-President for Canada. At the annual
convention of the C.M.A., held at Winnipeg in the summer of 1918, he was

=Freiman, Archibald J.=, who conducts one of the leading department
stores of Ottawa, at 73 Rideau Street, was born at Wirballen, Poland, on
June 6, 1880, the son of H. and Hannah Freiman. His early education was
received in Poland, which was supplemented on his coming to this country
in 1893, by courses in the public schools of Hamilton and at Hamilton
Business College. He commenced his business career in 1899, by
establishing the Canadian House Furnishing Company, at Kingston, Ont.,
in partnership with M. Cramer. In 1902 the business was removed to
Ottawa owing to the limited possibilities for development in Kingston.
In 1905, Mr. Cramer’s interest was purchased by Mr. Freiman, Sr., who
remained in partnership with his son until 1910, when Mr. A. J. Freiman
bought his father out and has since conducted the business in his own
name. He has been a pronounced success from the outset and is recognized
as one of the leading retail merchants of Eastern Ontario. He is an
orthodox Hebrew in religion and president of the Congregation Adath
Eshuroon. He is vice-president of the Zionist Federation of Canada; a

=Breadner, Robert Walker=, Commissioner of Taxation of the Department of
Finance and Dominion Appraiser, Department of Customs, Ottawa, is one of
the leading economic experts of the Dominion of Canada. He was born at
Athelstan, Quebec, on January 13, 1865, the son of the late Major Joshua
and Beatrice Dudgeon (Walker) Breadner. He was educated at the
Protestant Separate School of his native village, and later at the High
School of Port Henry, N.Y. He entered the civil service of the Dominion
in 1884 as a clerk in the Post Office Department, Ottawa. He was
transferred to the Customs Department in 1892 and in 1894 became chief
Check Clerk of that branch, a post he continued to hold in connection
with other duties until 1908. From 1898 to 1906 he also held the
position of Dominion Appraiser and in the latter year became Inspector
of Customs, holding the position until 1908. Throughout this period he
was also a member of the Board of Customs. It will be seen that few men
had had such a detailed experience in dealing with all the manifold
questions relating to tariffs, and in 1908 the Canadian Manufacturers
Association induced him to leave the service of the Government and
become manager of their Tariff Department. In this position he remained
for four years. In 1912, because of his expert knowledge, the newly
formed Borden Government induced him to return to the Civil Service as
Confidential Tariff Officer, also appointing him to his old position as
Dominion Appraiser and member of the Board of Customs. When during the
war the Government decided on its policy of taxing business profits, Mr.
Breadner was put in charge of the details and has given great
satisfaction by his efficient organization of the difficult task. In
addition to his many other duties Mr. Breadner found time to serve on
the Ottawa Board of Education for four years. He is a member of the
following clubs: Laurentian, Ottawa; Canada Bowling (Toronto), and these
societies: I.O.O.F., I.O.F., L.O.L., A.O.U.W., Royal Arcanum. He is a
Presbyterian in religion and on September 7, 1887, married Nellie,
daughter of Andrew D. Fraser, Ottawa. He has one son and four daughters,
and since his duties compelled his removal to Toronto has resided at 41
Albany Ave. in the latter city.

=Flavelle, William M.=, of Lindsay, Ont., is a sound, progressive
business man, who has played an important part in the development of
that section of Central Ontario adjacent to the home town. He was born
at Peterboro in March, 1853, where he attended the Public and High
Schools. His parents were John and Dorothea Flavelle; Sir Joseph
Flavelle, Baronet, of Toronto, is a brother, as also is Mr. J. D.
Flavelle, of Lindsay, Chairman of the Board of Ontario License
Commissioners. The subject of this sketch is one of the pioneers of the
Cold Storage business in Canada. Over thirty years ago he recognized the
necessity and value of the same as being of untold benefit to the
country, by means of which dairy and other perishable products of the
farm could be garnered in the seasons of their greatest production, and
conserved for future use in the non-producing intervals. The growth of
the enterprise has been of immense benefit to both producer and
consumer, as now many commodities, which would not be otherwise
available, may be freely purchased at any season in the year. The great
advancement of the business from the first simple storage, when natural
ice was used as the refrigerator, to the special brick structure
standing prominently on Lindsay’s main street, equipped with every
modern device and appliance, is the evidence of one man’s splendid
vision, business acumen, and sagacity. A natural adjunct to the Lindsay
Cold Storage Plant has been added in the way of a creamery, the first,
and one of the finest of its kind in Canada. Here the cream is received
from the farmers, tributary to the district, tested and manufactured
into the finest creamery product, to the mutual advantage of the farmer
and the country in general. In 1886 Mr. Flavelle married Mary Helen
Aird, daughter of Robert Aird, of Montreal. Six children blessed the
union, four sons and two daughters, viz.: Aird D., Stewart A., Gordon
A., Guy A., Jena L. and Helen Grace. He is President of Flavelle,
Limited, The Victoria Loan and Savings Company, The Lindsay Cemetery
Company, Dundas & Flavelle, Limited, and a member of the Public Library
Board. With his varied interests, Mr. Flavelle is a very busy man, but
finds relaxation and recreation in golf, motoring and boating. He is a
Methodist in religion, and a Liberal-Conservative in politics. Public
spirited, with a fine business reputation, he takes more than a passing
interest in matters of National importance and is keenly concerned in
all measures which will advance the community in which he has held a
prominent place for so many years.

West Flamboro, County of Wentworth, July 20, 1868, and was educated at
the West Flamboro Public School, the Hamilton Public Schools and the
Woodstock Baptist College. His father was Francis William Hore, who came
to Canada about the year 1837, when quite a young man, in company with
his parents, brothers and sisters; he was born in Sussex, England, and
was a grandson of Joseph Hore, of North Mundham, Chichester, Sussex,
England; his mother was Sophia Fearman, who in the year 1833, with other

schooner to Port Dalhousie; thence to Hamilton in a farmer’s hay rack.
F. W. Hore, father of the subject of this sketch, was a man of
exceptional ability and was one of the earlier settlers who helped to
build up the manufacturing industries of this country to their present
high position, as is shown by the magnificent factory standing to his
credit in Hamilton, known as F. W. Hore & Son, Limited, manufacturers of
Fine Carriage, Waggon and Sleigh Wood-work. Following in his footsteps,
George C. Hore commenced work in his father’s factory at the age of
fifteen years, to learn the business, and with the exception of a short
time at College, has been at it continuously and steadily ever since.
The Company of F. W. Hore & Son, Limited, are extensive manufacturers,
and their product is well and favorably known from the Atlantic to the
Pacific. They have the pleasure of showing in their office, records of
many first prizes and medals taken in the pioneer days of their
business, testifying to the quality of their product. They are believers
in the old saying that “quality will be remembered long after the price
is forgotten.” The business has been established between forty and
forty-five years, and Mr. Hore is ably assisted in the management by his
brother and other officers of the Company. He was married September 21,
1912, to Miss Emma Lenz, of Hamilton. In religion he is a member of the
Church of England; in politics, a Conservative, and is fond of outdoor
sports—being a member of the Victoria Bowling Club and the Hamilton Gun

=Dickson, Rev. James A. R., B.D.= (Galt, Ont.), was born in Tranent,
Scotland, on October 22, 1839. His father was David Dickson, a pious
man, who was careful of the godly upbringing of his children, and being
a zealous Free Churchman, instructed them in the standards of that
church. Mr. Dickson came to Canada in the summer of 1857 to an uncle in
Brantford, who was engaged in business there, where he resided for some
time. His uncle attending the ministry of the Rev. John Wood, of the
Congregational Church, he went with him, and under the faithful
preaching of Mr. Wood, experienced the great change which altered the
entire current of his life. He was active in Christian work in the
Sabbath school and Y.M.C.A., but an irrepressible longing for wider
usefulness led him to prepare for the Christian ministry. He took
private lessons in Latin and Greek, attended the Brantford Grammar
School for several sessions, and in 1860 entered the Congregational
College of B.N.A. in Toronto, which was then under the principalship of
Adam Lillie, D.D. While pursuing theological studies here, he attended
classes in Logic, Hebrew, Latin and Greek in University College;
mathematics, metaphysics and other subjects being taken up by special
masters appointed by the board of the Congregational College. In 1864
the college being removed to Montreal, he attended the McGill College,
studying zoology, botany and geology under Sir William Dawson, LL.D.;
Hebrew under Dr. De Sola, and logic, English literature and moral
philosophy under Canon Leach. He graduated in 1865, and was called to
the Congregational Church in London, Ontario, where he remained for six
years. While here he edited for three years _The Gospel Message_, a
monthly, published in Montreal. He published “Working for Jesus,” which
is now and has been for the past thirteen years, issued by the American
Tract Society of New York, and the Religious Tract Society of London.
Also a 32-page tract, “Saved or Not?” and “Counsels for Young Converts.”
In June, 1867, he married Isabella E., eldest daughter of Walter
Fairbairn of London, Ontario. In 1871 he was called to the Northern
Church, Toronto. Here he remained about eight years, till he changed his
ecclesiastical relations, returning to the church of his fathers. While
in Toronto he was honored with the highest position in the gift of the
Congregational churches, being elected Chairman of the Congregational
Union, of Ontario and Quebec in 1877. Here he began to write for the
“Sunday School Times,” “Sunday School World,” and “Canada Presbyterian,”
to which he has been a frequent contributor. He published “Immediately,”
“The Rest of Faith,” “Christian Culture,” “A Good Minister of Jesus
Christ,” tracts which have had an extensive circulation. He was chosen
secretary of the Upper Canada Tract Society in 1874, which he held until
1879. On resigning his charge in Toronto, he visited for five months the
branch societies of the Upper Canada Tract Society. He filled Dr.
Cochrane’s pulpit in Brantford for three months, while the Doctor was in
Britain in 1879. While here he was called to Galt, and settled there on
October 13, 1879. Since his settlement in Galt he has published
“Expository Bible Readings,” “Working for the Children,” and a tract
entitled “A Word in Season.” On the regulations being issued for the
conferring of the degree of Bachelor of Divinity, Mr. Dickson went to
Montreal Presbyterian College, and passing the examinations proper to
the degree, took it in March, 1883. The congregation of Galt built for
him in 1881 one of the handsomest ecclesiastical structures in Canada.
It is mentioned in “Picturesque Canada.” In 1887 the Religious Tract
Society of London, England, published a little volume of Mr. Dickson’s

the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.), by Wooster University, Ohio,
one of the great schools of learning belonging to the Presbyterian
Church in the United States. He attained the degree by a stated course
of special study in Political Economy and Social Science, and by
examinations therein. He prepared also a paper to lay before the faculty
on “Conscience the Living Source of Human Law.” In 1896 the Religious
Tract Society of New York published a volume by Dr. Dickson, entitled
“The Truth that Saves and How to Present It.” In 1904 Dr. Dickson wrote

=Choquette, Philippe Auguste, LL.B.= (Quebec, Que.), Advocate, Senator
and Judge of the Sessions, Quebec, was born on the 6th of January, 1854,
at Beloeil, County of Vercheres. His ancestors came from Amiens,
Picardie, France, in 1643, and settled in Varennes, in the county where
the subject of our sketch was born. His parents were Joseph Choquette,
farmer, and Marie Thais Audet. He received his education at St.
Hyacinthe College, and at Laval University, Quebec, and graduated
B.C.L., from the latter institution in 1880, having previously taken the
silver medal given by the then Governor-General, Lord Lorne, receiving,
in 1899, the degree of LL.D. While he was prosecuting his studies at
Laval, he acted as private secretary to the late Hon. Honore Mercier,
then solicitor-general in the Joly administration, and later on Premier
of Quebec Province. He held for about three years and a half the
position of commercial traveller in a wholesale boot and shoe
establishment in St. Hyacinthe, before he began to study law. He moved
to Quebec in 1887, and entered the office of the Hon. François
Langelier, then a Member of Parliament and Mayor of Quebec (who died in
1915 as Lieutenant-Governor), to study law. After being admitted to the
bar of Lower Canada, in 1880, he removed to Montmagny, where he
successfully practised his profession. Since 1877 he has been a
contributor to “L’Union,” of St. Hyacinthe, director of “Le Soleil” in
1905-06, having before, in 1883, founded “Le Sentinelle,” of Montmagny,
still existing under the name of “Le Courier de Montmagny.” In 1878 he
began to take an active part in politics and in 1882 he ran for a seat
in the House of Commons against A. C. P. R. Landry, now Senator, the
then Conservative candidate, but was defeated by a majority of 120
votes. At the general election held in 1887, he again presented himself
in opposition to Mr. Landry, and this time carried his election by a
majority of 195 votes, and was re-elected in 1911-1916 by large
majorities. Mr. Choquette has travelled through the principal parts of
the United States and Europe. He has been Secretary of the Reform Club
of the County of Montmagny. In politics he is a strong Liberal, a free
trader, and in favor of commercial union. In 1898, was appointed a Judge
of the Superior Court; resigned in 1904 and was called to the Senate. In
1915 was by the local Government named Judge of the Sessions of the
Peace for Quebec District. He is an adherent of the Roman Catholic
Church, but objects to the clergy interfering and mixing in political
contests. On the 29th of August, 1883, he was married to Marie, daughter
of A. Bender, prothonotary of the Superior Court, and granddaughter of
the late Sir E. P. Tache, baronet, A.D.C. to her late Majesty the Queen,
and one of the promoters of Confederation. As recreations he favors
music and sports, and has been President of the Quebec Hockey Club from
1913 to the present time (1917). He resides at 56 Conroy St., Ottawa.

=Tytler, William, B.A.=, Inspector of Public Schools, Guelph, Ont., was
born on Jan. 5, 1842, in the Township of Nichol, near Elora, Wellington
County, Ontario. His father was William Tytler, and his mother, Jane
Inglis Forbes, aunt of Archibald Forbes, the celebrated special war
correspondent. Mr. Tytler pursued his educational studies in the town of
Elora, attending the Grammar school of that place, after he had passed
the primary departments. A university course was planned, and he
matriculated at the University of Toronto. His course here was
characterized by industry, and he was especially distinguished in
science and classics. He graduated in 1862, taking the gold medal for
natural sciences. Mr. Tytler has likewise something of a military
record. He has been a private in the Queen’s Own, Toronto University
Company, and has been a member of volunteer companies at Carleton Place
and at Smith’s Falls, Lanark County. The City of Guelph was the first to
take advantage of the free libraries act; and in 1862, a library was
established there, Mr. Tytler being secretary and chief worker in
connection with that institution. He married on the 23rd July, 1879,
Martha C. Harrison, younger daughter of Milner Harrison, of St. Mary’s.
He is a member of the Presbyterian Church. We may say that Mr. Tytler at
once turned his attention to the work of teaching upon graduation; and
his record has been a very creditable one since he was head master of
the Carleton Place Grammar School, during 1863 and 1864; of the Smith’s
Falls Grammar School from 1865 to 1868; of the St. Mary’s High School
from 1869 to 1874; and was appointed head master of the Guelph
Collegiate Institute, in February, 1875. Mr. Tytler, it can be said
without any exaggeration, stands in the front rank of the Canadian
teaching profession. He is a sound scholar; and he brings both industry
and enthusiasm into his work. In 1892, owing to ill health, he resigned
his position, and was soon afterwards appointed Inspector of Public
Schools for the city of Guelph, a position which he still holds.

=Commeford, James W.= (Toronto, Ont.), was born in Toronto, April 6,
1877, and was educated in the public and high schools. Having decided to
follow life as an electrical engineer and contractor he gave
considerable of his time in educating himself along those lines and when
satisfied as to his ability he branched out into business for himself on
College Street, where he is located at the present time. He has been
very successful and has to his credit to-day one of the largest
electrical businesses in the city, carrying a large staff of employees
the year round. Mr. Commeford was induced to offer himself as a
candidate for alderman in Ward Four, many citizens believing that his
expert knowledge as an electrician would be beneficial to the city at
large, and was defeated by a very small margin, meaning a great loss
from a city standpoint, owing to the installation of the Hydro-Electric
System, when his services would have been invaluable. However, youth is
on his side, and Mr. Commeford will not only be elected alderman, but
will fill higher offices should he desire the honor. He is widely known
in yachting circles and acquatic sports, being a member of the Queen
City Yacht Club, National Yacht and Skiff Club, Alexandra Yacht Club and
Rochester Yacht Club. He is honorary president of the Lake Sailing Skiff
Association and President of the Canadian Power Boat Association. He has
donated the Motor Cycle Championship Cup, and the Long Distance
Endurance Cup of the Canadian Power Boat Association. Mr. Commeford has
saved thirty-three lives from drowning in Lake Ontario and received four
medals from the Humane Society for his brave and timely acts. In
politics he is a Conservative and an active party man.

disputes that had arisen in the city of Ottawa between the city and the
owners of land, the Ontario Government appointed Mr. Hill as Official
Arbitrator and in that capacity he is now employed. He has also, on
several occasions, been called upon to act as Chairman of Conciliation
Boards appointed to settle disputes between employers and employees. In

is largely due to the efforts of Mr. James Ballantyne, Justice of the
Peace, who, when Ottawa East was a village, was the most active,
efficient and prominent man in the vicinity. It was he, as one of its
public men, who looked after the finances, who was active in placing the
water works system on a paying basis, and to whom credit is due for the
many improvements that were made in its streets, roadways, parks, and
other general matters. He took good care of the baby settlement, watched
and guarded the progress, and succeeded in having it become annexed to
the city of Ottawa; and now, in his advanced years, he sits contentedly
in his home and views with delight the rapid progress that is being made
in the erection of buildings, the handsomely paved streets and the
increase in population. Mr. James Ballantyne is a member of the firm of
J. & T. Ballantyne, Coal Merchants, 80 Elgin St., Ottawa. He is the son
of Francis and Marion (Nichol) Ballantyne, and was born at New
Castleton, Scotland, May 9, 1835. He was educated at the Public and High
Schools, and at Queen’s College, Kingston. He started in business with
J. & T. Ballantyne, manufacturers of woodenware in Ottawa in 1863, and
in 1890 established the present firm of J. & T. Ballantyne, Coal
Merchants. At one time he was Manager and Director of the Ottawa East
Water Co., was a member of the County Council for nine years, and
Secretary-Treasurer of the Ottawa East Public Schools for fifteen years.
In 1862 Mr. Ballantyne married Mary Foster, daughter of Adam Foster, of
Cumberland, England. Two sons and two daughters have blessed the union.
Mr. Ballantyne is a Protestant in religion, a Liberal in politics, and
he resides at 54 Main Street, Ottawa East, Canada.

=Baskerville, William Joseph=, is the son of George Baskerville by his
wife, Mary McDonnell, and was born at Townland, Ballyrushen, Tipperary,
Ireland, October 2nd, 1843. His father was the son of Benjamin
Baskerville, who was descended from an old Norman family which settled
in Ireland about the time of William the Conqueror, in 1066. The family
records were unfortunately destroyed by fire in 1858 and included a
great deal of matter that would have been of interest to the public. His
father, George Baskerville adopted the calling of a farmer in Ireland,
but in 1847 concluded to come to Canada. In the summer of that year he
landed in Bytown, now Ottawa, and engaged in the trading and grocery
business. In the fire of 1858 they lost all their household effects, as
well as whatever savings they had accumulated, and having no insurance,
the family had to start anew in life, and at the time of their father’s
death, in 1875, they were again in comfortable circumstances. Their
mother died in 1867. They had nine of a family. The subject of this
sketch, William Joseph Baskerville, was the fifth son. He received his
early education in the common schools, and later at Ottawa College, now
the University of Ottawa. In 1870 he formed a partnership with his
brothers, Patrick and George, under the firm name and style of P.
Baskerville & Bros., carrying on a retail grocery and liquor business
until the year 1880, when they discontinued the retail, and carried on a
wholesale business only. The business was carried on until the year
1904, when his two brothers having predeceased him, he retired. Since
that he has been engaged in real estate, stocks, and bonds and building
operations. In the year 1880, although still a partner in the firm of P.
Baskerville & Bros., he engaged in the contracting business, along with
James O’Connor and Patrick Cassidy. They were the successful bidders for
the Locks at Saint Anne’s de Bellevue, which work they completed in
1884. He was always a keen admirer of good sport, particularly lacrosse,
and was a Director of the Capital Lacrosse Club from 1892, the year of
their amalgamation with the Ottawas, until 1898. He was also a Director
of the Capital Athletic Association until 1901. He is a shareholder in
the Ottawa Electric Railway, the Ottawa Car Company, Rideau Townsite
Company, Nipissing Mining Company, Mining Corporation of Canada, the
Bytown and Aylmer Union Company, the Northern Life Insurance Company,
the Moose Jaw Electric Railway, the Southern Canada Power Company, Ltd.,

electricity and with its planing mills, head offices, large general
store, church, school, bakery, lumber, boat works and handsome
homes—the creation of this great lumber industry and owned entirely by
Mr. Lumsden—is nothing but hustle and bustle from morning till night
and the abode of a happy and contented people who take great delight in
watching the wheels of industry spinning and in doing their share
towards the successful termination of each day’s labor. At his mills
between 125,000 and 130,000 feet of lumber and 30,000 laths and pickets
are turned out per day and sent to the piling grounds ready to be
shipped to the markets of the world—to wherever the demand calls for
them. While Mr. Lumsden has all these details and commercial and
financial responsibilities resting upon his shoulders and demanding his
careful administrative and executive attention he can, and does, find
time to make his racing establishments truly representative on the
American turf at Maryland, Saratoga and other places. His horses
represent a big investment—there are between 20 and 30 of
them—two-year-olds, three-year-olds, seasoned campaigners, jumpers,
etc., and most of them are a gilt-edge breeding of British and Irish
Stock and racers of the swiftest class to whom many prizes and honors
have fallen. Mr. Lumsden is President, Dominion Explosives, Ltd., La
Banque Nationale Building, Ottawa; President, Lumsden Lumber Company,
Ltd., Ottawa; Director, Forwarders, Ltd., Kingston; Director, Caledonia
Realties, Ltd., Montreal; Director, Security Life Insurance Company of
Canada; Life Governor, St. Luke’s Hospital, Ottawa, and is closely
associated with many other philanthropic and business interests. He was
born at Ottawa, June 24, 1870, and is the son of the late Alexander
Lumsden, M.P.P., and Margueretta Lumsden, of Scottish descent. He began
his business career in the lumber business with his father and served
apprenticeship as a machinist with the Patterson Law of Ottawa. He was
chief engineer on a lake steamer from 1891 to 1893; was with the Laurie
Engineering Company, Montreal; associated with his father, 1903-1905. In
the latter year he went into business for himself. He established

Since his entry into Parliamentary life Mr. Weichel has greatly
distinguished himself as a public speaker, and has been especially
fearless and outspoken in support of the Military Service Act and of the
Union Government. Mr. Weichel, although of German origin, is very loyal
to the country of his birth, and to British institutions. In the general
elections held in 1917 Mr. Weichel was again a candidate, but was
defeated owing to the peculiar war-time conditions existing in the
riding he had so brilliantly and faithfully represented. He has a good
platform presence and speaks with fluency and earnestness in support of
his convictions, doing everything in his power to promote harmony and a
good understanding among his constituents and to secure the successful
termination of the great conflict in favor of the British Empire. Mr.
Weichel married, on August 19, 1896, Jessie R., daughter of Richard
Kinsman, of Galt, and has three daughters, Norine, Minota and Audrey. He

=Watson, Sir David, K.C.B. and Brigadier-General= (Quebec City),
promoted to take command of the 4th Canadian Division of the forces at
the front in April, 1916, is a native of the city of Quebec, having been
born in that city on February 7, 1869. He is the only son of Mr. William
Watson, his mother’s maiden name having been Miss Jean Grant, daughter
of one of Quebec’s well-known merchants of Lower Town. From school and
after some preliminary training in municipal work, he passed into the
“Chronicle” office, when Mr. John J. Foote was manager and proprietor of
the paper, and there worked his way up through the various departments
of journalism, until he finally became the managing director of the
establishment. He has held the office of President of the Quebec Press
Association, and visited London for a first time as a delegate to the
Imperial Press Congress, held in that city in 1908, and a third time as
commander of the 8th Royal Rifles during the royal celebration of 1901.
In the military life of Quebec he has been interested for over twenty
years, and during that time was given promotion step by step until he
was in command of his battalion as its Colonel, a position which he had
held for two or three years before the European War broke out. Having
been selected to take charge of the 2nd Battalion in the 1st Brigade of
the 1st Canadian Division, in August, 1914, he proceeded from the
Valcartier Camp with troops in charge, for their further training at
Salisbury Plains; and, after spending the early winter months there, he
proceeded to the front in January, 1915. He was by this time a Colonel
in full rank. At the seat of war he was continuously engaged as a
commanding officer all during the campaigning up to the summer of 1917,
having taken part with his Division in the operations of Neuve Chapelle,
in March, 1915, as well as in the second battle of Ypres in April, in
the fight at Festubert in May, and that of Givenchy in June. In
recognition of his skill and prudence in these engagements he was
promoted to command the 5th Brigade of the 2nd Canadian Division in the
month of August following, and forthwith as a Brigadier-General, he led
his Brigade in the successive engagements of Wytschaete, Kemmel, and St.
Eloi, during the spring of 1916. Subsequently he was placed in charge of
the 4th Canadian Division and made extended raids in the Ypres salient
and at St. Eloi, and thereafter, for forty-nine days without
intermission, he and his Brigade shared in the exciting engagements
along the River Somme. No less than three attacks were made by General
Watson and his Division, one on the 11th of October, another on the 22nd
of that month, and one on the 18th of November, 1916, all of these
accumulating renown by their intrepid approach on the enemy. Nor was the
commander’s bravery overlooked by the War Office, since General Watson
has come in for special mention in the despatches exchanged between the
general Field Staff and the War Department no less than four times. He
was awarded the high honor of Commander of the Bath, and in 1918 was
further honored by a Knighthood in that order. The record of the
General’s active service at the front is a fitting complement to a
career of over twenty years’ experience in military operations, from the
days of his entering the 8th Royal Rifles, made up of his Quebec
fellow-citizens, to the time of his being a General in full command of
the battlefields of Europe. His career savors of romance. A newspaper
employee, a prominent business man in his native city, a volunteer of
the ranks, a captain, a major, a colonel, and at last a general, form
the grades of a ladder overcome step by step which his fellow-Canadians
cannot but contemplate with pride. It was taken for granted that in the
event of Sir Arthur Currie’s transfer to another command Sir David would
succeed him as Commander-in-Chief of the Canadian army in France.
General Watson married Miss Mary Browning, of Quebec, on September 11,
1893, and has a family of three daughters.

whose farm was one of the best, the owner having brought his splendid
Scotch knowledge into one of the finest settlements in the Dominion,
where success and shrewd business ability crowned his labors. This son
of worthy parents had a longing for knowledge and professional life, and
as a youth was studious in S.S. No. 8, Bruce, having his thirst for
knowledge awakened and developed along proper lines. His next step was
to the High School in Port Elgin, from which he successfully
matriculated. He then went to business college for half a year, which
was followed by duties in railroad office work. While thus employed he
decided that his life work would be that of a doctor. He attended
Toronto University and was awarded the degree of Bachelor of Medicine in
1911. Of a likeable and charming disposition he was ever a favorite at
college, and was honored by his fellow students in the University by
being made Treasurer of the “At Home” Committee of the year ’11. His
Scotch ancestry and faithful application to his profession have made him
friends, and few young men have reached the splendid position he now
occupies. He came back home and settled in the village of Tiverton,
where his practice is large and continually growing. Success has crowned

humanity, and his splendid abilities are often called for in
consultation with his surrounding fellow practitioners, all of whom

=Honeywell, Major Frederick Henry, B.A.=, is a prominent Ottawa
barrister and military man who, during the late war, distinguished
himself by serving his country at the front. He was born in Carleton
County, Ont., on Dec. 12, 1877, son of Elkanah and Marie (Baldwin)
Honeywell, and received his education at the public schools of
Westboro’, Carleton County, at Ottawa Collegiate Institute and at
Toronto University. He qualified for the law and after being called to
the Bar established himself in practice at Ottawa, where he is head of
the firm of Honeywell, Caldwell & Wilson, Barristers and Solicitors,

Princess Louise Dragoon Guards, Ottawa. Offering himself for service
overseas he was appointed Major of the 8th Canadian Mounted Rifles in
the Canadian Expeditionary Force, in which capacity he went to the
front. He was later attached to the 26th Battalion of the British
Expeditionary Force in France, on active service, and participated in
several noted engagements. He is essentially an outdoor man and his
recreations include curling, skating, ski-ing, golf, motoring and motor

=Wainwright, Arnold, K.C., B.C.L.=, one of the leading barristers and
publicists of Montreal was born in that city on June 13, 1879, the son
of William and Mary Emily (Arnold) Wainwright. His education was
unusually complete. After a course at Montreal Collegiate Institute he
entered McGill University, from which he graduated in 1890 with the
degree of B.A. and honors and medal in mental and moral philosophy. This
was supplemented by a course in law and in 1902 he obtained the degree
of B.C.L. with a medal. Subsequently he took a post-graduate course at
the University of Montpelier, France. He was called to the bar in 1902
and is now a member of the firm of Davidson, Wainwright, Alexander &
Elder, Advocates, Transportation Building, Montreal. In 1912 he was
created King’s Counsel on attaining the requisite ten years’ service at
the bar. He was elected President of the Junior Bar Association of
Montreal in 1910 and a member of the Council of the Montreal Bar for
1911-12. In addition to being recognized as a brilliant speaker both in
the forensic and political arenas, Mr. Wainwright is a recognized

=McConnell, Richard George=, Deputy Minister of Mines, and Director of
the Geographical Survey for Canada, was born at Chatham, Quebec, March
26, 1857, the son of Andrew and Martha (Bradford) McConnell. He was
educated at the Caribou Academy and at McGill University, from which he
graduated with the degree of B.A. in 1879, taking first class honors in
Natural Science. On graduation he immediately went to the Canadian West
as assistant to the famous Canadian geologist, Dr. G. N. Dawson, whose
name is immortalized in Dawson City, the capital of the Yukon Territory.
Upon his return to the East in 1881 Mr. McConnell entered the service of
the Canadian Geological Survey and made many explorations in behalf of
the government which resulted in valuable discoveries in Western Canada,
British Columbia and the Yukon. In 1887 and 1888 he headed one of the
most extensive exploratory expeditions on record, traversing almost the
whole country drained by the Stikine, Liard, Mackenzie, Porcupine, Yukon
and Lewis Rivers. The results of his investigations are to be found in
many reports and articles on the Geological and Mineral Resources of
Western Canada. On this subject he is recognized in professional circles
throughout the world as the chief living authority. In fact it is
doubtful whether any man, past or present has acquired such an intimate
first-hand knowledge of the great Sub-Arctic areas of Western Canada. As
a geologist his fame is international, and he is a prominent member of
the Geological Society of America as well as of the Royal Society of
Canada. His recreations are curling and golf and he is a member of the
Ottawa Golf Club. In religion he is a Presbyterian, and was married in
November, 1898, to Jeannie, daughter of E. H. Botterell, Montreal. His
family consists of one son and one daughter, and his home is at
“Edgehill,” Rockliffe, Ottawa.

=Currie, General Sir Arthur William, C.B., G.C.M.G.=, Commander-in-chief
of the Canadian Army on the Western front during the latter stages of
the great war, was born at the village of Napperton, Middlesex County,
Ontario, December 5, 1875, the son of William Garner and Jane Currie. He
was educated at the public school of his district and later at Strathroy
Collegiate Institute. Going to British Columbia in 1893 when but
eighteen years of age he first engaged in school teaching at Sidney,
B.C. Later he located in Victoria, B.C., and entered on a business
career. At the time the war broke out he was the head of the firm of
Currie & Power, one of the leading real estate concerns of Vancouver
Island. Nearest to his heart, however, were military pursuits, and he
early identified himself with the 5th Canadian Garrison Artillery, in
which he served fourteen years, rising ultimately to the rank of
Lieutenant-Colonel. With him, however, military activity was not merely
a case of dress parades, but a real pursuit. He devoted himself
seriously to the study of modern tactics, not only in connection with
his own arm of the service but infantry as well. He used his influence
to encourage rifle shooting, and from 1907 onward was President of the
British Columbia Rifle Association. On the outbreak of the war followed
by the decision of the Canadian Government to send an Expeditionary
Force to the front, Col. Currie was recognized as one of the most
efficient volunteer officers in this country, and when Sir Sam Hughes
telegraphed him asking him to accept a command he did not hesitate to
offer his services. He was assigned to the command of the Vancouver
Highland Battalion, which trained at Valcartier Camp, and went overseas
in the late autumn of 1914 to complete its training on Salisbury Plain.
The regiment was one of the first Canadian units sent to France, and in
the terrible fighting at St. Julien and Langemarck in connection with
the second battle of Ypres, April, 1915, had its baptism of blood. This
was the engagement of which Viscount French reported to the War Office
“The Canadians saved the day.” In this severe test Colonel Currie won a
reputation for leadership and courage of the highest order which has
distinguished him ever since. He received enthusiastic praise from
General Alderson, the Imperial officer then in command of the Canadian
division, and on the latter’s recommendation was accorded the coveted
D.S.O. and given command of a brigade. His service as brigade commander
proved so completely successful that his work won the attention of the
British Headquarters Staff, and when a reorganization of commands ensued
as a result of the arrival of two new Canadian divisions in the field,
he was elevated to the rank of Major-General and placed in charge of the
First Division of the Canadian Army. In this post he commanded his
division at the Battle of Hooge, when it resisted the full force of the
German assault in what was described as “this particular hell of Hooge.”
His cool and brilliant handling of what was admittedly a critical
situation for all forces on the bloody Ypres salient won him the
unstinted praise of his immediate chief-in-command, General Sir Julian
Byng, and all the other British military experts. The correspondent of
the London “Times” reported that nothing finer was ever seen in warfare
than the manner in which the lines over Maple Cape, Observatory Ridge
and Armagh Wood were held by the troops under General Currie’s command.
Sir Julian Byng in his report said “I am proud of the Canadian troops
under my command. Their behaviour has been magnificent. I have never
known fiercer or more deadly barrage, nor have I seen any troops fight
with more earnestness, courage and cheerfulness.” He especially praised
General Currie’s counter attack with the Canadian division at 1.30 on
the morning of June 13, 1916, on a front of 500 yards extending from
Sanctuary Wood to Hill 60, when heavy losses were inflicted on the
Germans and prisoners taken. The spring of 1917 was marked by glorious
achievement on the part of the Canadian troops, including the captures
of Messines Ridge and Vimy Ridge, and finally attaining the investment
of Lens. In the midst of the spring campaign Sir Julian Byng was shifted
to the command of a British Army. General Currie was at once recognized
as his logical successor and became the Chief-in-Command of the Canadian
Army in the field with four divisions under him. The victory of Vimy
which was heralded throughout the world as a great military achievement,
was generally credited to General Currie’s masterly powers of
preparation and organization. It was in recognition of these services
that His Majesty King George knighted him on the field of Vimy as a
member of the Order of St. Michael and St. George. Earlier still he had
been made a Companion of the Bath. It was on June 19, 1917, that he
assumed the chief command, and one of his first achievements was the
capture of Hill 70 on his own initiative, rendering the important mining
city of Lens, which had been in German occupation for nearly three
years, untenable for military uses by the enemy. General Currie could
have occupied Lens any time during the summer of 1917 that it was deemed
desirable, but owing to the belief of the French Government that its
capture would only result in further destruction, without military
advantage, the word to advance was withheld. Instead, during the autumn
of 1917 General Currie and his army were assigned by Sir Douglas Haig to
one of the most terrible tasks that was ever allotted to a military
force. It was that of taking Passchendaele Ridge in Flanders with a view
to getting to Roulers and cutting off the U-Boat bases of Zeebrugge and
Ostend. Sir Douglas Haig assigned the task to the Canadians because he
believed that under the command of General Currie they had developed
into the best “shock” troops in the world. The Germans on the other hand
believed that Passchendaele Ridge was impregnable, and many military
experts agreed with them; but the U-Boat menace was such that the
attempt was deemed to be justified by necessity. Before the attack
General Currie personally addressed his men, and did not disguise what
they had to face, but so fired them with the spirit of victory that
despite terrible losses they carried the Ridge. It was one of the
tragedies of the war that the Flanders winter closed down so suddenly
that it was impossible to reap the full fruits of victory by advancing
to Roulers. By spring the situation had been absolutely changed by the
great German offensive of March, 1918, and Passchendaele was temporarily
abandoned. This circumstance did not alter the greatness of the original
achievement, attained in obedience to the orders of the Headquarters
command. In the final stages of the war which gave the Allies victory
the Canadian army under General Currie played a role of immortal lustre.
They entered in the fighting in full force on August 8, 1918, and from
thence onward until the signing of the armistice on November 11 victory
after victory crowned their banners. The greatest of their achievements
was perhaps the breaking of the Drocourt-Queant Switch Line, a part of
the great “Hindenburg” defence system, which the Germans had also
boasted was impregnable. When General Currie achieved this victory and
opened the road to Cambrai it was at once recognized by war experts, and
even by German critics, that Marshal Foch’s strategy could succeed in a
much shorter period than had been anticipated if such efforts could be
repeated on other parts of the Allied front. As everyone knows this
prognostication was not falsified. Before the war was over General
Currie and his army had to their credit the capture of Cambrai and of
Valenciennes, two of the most vital points in the German resistance. Two
hours before the armistice was signed General Currie rode as a conqueror
into Mons, the point where the old “contemptibles” of the original
British Army had first shown their prowess against the Germans in 1914.
During the cleaning-up operations following the war, his administrative
abilities have proven most valuable. On New Year’s Day, 1919, his
services were further recognized by bestowing on him the honor of Grand
Cross of St. Michael and St. George, an order in which he was already a
Knight. It must not be forgotten also that in the critical period when
Canada’s maintenance of her forces in France was in doubt, General
Currie’s voice had great weight in determining the action of the people
of this country. He strongly urged on Sir Robert Borden and other
ministers that this country should do everything in its power to help
win the war and meet the condition caused by the falling off of
enlistments, a condition which was threatening the dissolution of his
ever-victorious army. The result was the decision of the Canadian
Government to adopt the policy of conscription. During the election
campaign that ensued he sent the following message to the Canadian
people on behalf of himself and his staff: “We sincerely sympathize with
endeavors to arouse our countrymen to the necessity of remaining united
and firm in their determination to furnish troops in the field all
necessary support. We deeply deplore the fact that the wisdom of doing
so has become a subject for debate and controversy by those at home. If
support is now withheld or even delayed it means that additional burdens
will have to be borne by men already doing the seemingly impossible.”
This message coming from the most eminent of Canadian soldiers and one
who in private life had been a political opponent of the Borden
administration, could not fail to bring thousands of electors to a sense
of their duty to the soldier in the field. There have been rumors that
an effort would be made to induce General Currie to enter Canadian
politics as a Liberal leader on his return from the front, but so far he
has refused to assent to any such proposals. He is an Anglican in
religion and was married in 1901 to Miss L. S. Chaworth-Masters of
Victoria, B.C., by whom he has one daughter. A quiet man of iron
determination and marvellous powers of organization, he is, however,
certain to play a prominent role in the life of Canada in future,
whatever path he may elect to follow.

importance had he so desired. Whenever he was put forward as a candidate
for any office—public, political, educational, sporting or social, his
election was assured, and when he consented at a most critical time in
the history of Ottawa’s Municipal Administration, to be a candidate for
Controller he polled the largest majority ever secured by any man
running for public office in the city. In addition Mr. McClennaghan is
profoundly patriotic and public spirited and ever since the war started
has been active, energetic and generous in helping forward Canada’s
effort. His son, Lieut. Stewart Lyon McClennaghan served in France with
distinction in the Royal Flying Corps, and his nephew, Lieut. Vivian S.
C. McClennaghan of the Canadian Engineers, son of Mr. James McClennaghan
of the Marine Dept., has been awarded the Military Cross for bravery
while in charge of an important tract which was being heavily shelled
and bombed and completed his task though twice buried by shell fire. In
1889 Mr. Stewart McClennaghan formed a partnership with the late Mr. M.
D. MacKay as merchant tailors under the name of the 2 Macs—McClennaghan
& MacKay. Three years later, in 1892, Mr. McClennaghan bought out Mr.
MacKay and continued in the business until 1904 when he organized a
joint stock company under the name of the 2 Macs, Limited, he becoming
President and Managing-Director. To-day the business is recognized as
one of the largest outfitting establishments in Canada, handling
everything in boys’ and men’s wear, and occupying some 5,000 square feet
of floor space, with a frontage of 100 feet on Bank Street, 66 feet on
Sparks Street, and 33 feet on Queen Street, with the prospects in
evidence that considerably more space will shortly be necessary if the
business continues to expand as it has during the past decade. From 1900
to 1908 Mr. McClennaghan was a member of the Public School Board and was
chairman for two years, and from 1908 to 1911 he was a member of the
Ottawa Collegiate Institute Board from which he resigned to run for
Controller of the City of Ottawa, as above stated. During the existence
of the City’s Publicity Board Mr. McClennaghan was Chairman. Mr.
McClennaghan is Chairman of the Carnegie Library Board and has been a
member of the Board for many years. He is President of the Central
Canada Exhibition Association. His first year of office, 1917,
terminated with the Exhibition showing the largest receipts ever
obtained in the history of the Association. He is a Justice of the Peace
for the City of Ottawa and for the County of Carleton. He is a member of
the Council of the Board of Trade, and has been a member of the Board
for years. In amateur sports Mr. McClennaghan has been prominently
identified for many years. In 1890 he won the gold medal presented by
the Ottawa Amateur Association for the one mile snow shoe championship
of the city. He was President of the Ottawa Bicycle Club and a member of
their racing team. He was Chairman of the Board Committee of the Ottawa
Athletic Club for several years. He is one of the promoters of the
Connaught Park Jockey Club, became Vice-President, and is now Chairman
of the Management Committee. He is Vice-President of the Sportsmen’s
Patriotic Association, and it is he who is responsible for and was one
of the original Committee who started the Prescott and Ottawa Highway
Scheme. From 1916 to 1918 Mr. McClennaghan was President of the Ottawa
Liberal Conservative (now Unionist) Association. Mr. Stewart
McClennaghan is the son of William John (Contractor) and Sarah (Boyd)
McClennaghan and a nephew of Mr. N. K. Boyd, ex.-M.P. for MacDonald,
Manitoba. He was born at Oxford Mills, Ontario, July 14, 1866, and he
was educated at the Ottawa Public Schools. August 19, 1895, he married
Matilda A. Lyon, daughter of the late John G. and Victoria Lyon, of
Ottawa. The union has been blessed with two sons and five
daughters—Lieut. Stewart Lyon, Nora Boyd, Hilda Brook, Ruth Hasley,
Helen Read, Hugh John, Doris Victoria. He is a member of the following
Clubs: Laurentian, Rivermead Golf, Victoria Yacht, Abitibi Fish and
Game, and of the following Societies: Masonic, Oddfellows, Foresters and
Workmen. In religion he is Anglican and in politics Conservative. For
recreation he indulges in golf, hunting and yachting. His military
career was spent in the ranks of the Princess Louise Dragoon Guards. His
place of residence is 330 Cooper Street, Ottawa, Ontario.

=Buchanan, William A., M.P.= (Lethbridge, Alta.), Publisher, was born in
Fraserville, Peterboro County, Ont., July 2, 1876; the son of Rev. Wm.
Buchanan. His earlier education took place in the Public and High
Schools of Trenton, Brighton and Norwood, Ont. He first became
interested in newspaper work in Peterboro, Ont., and later was News
Editor of the “Evening Telegram,” Toronto, removing from there to accept
the position of managing director of the St. Thomas Journal; remaining
in that position until 1905, when he decided to try his fortune in the
West, locating at Lethbridge, Alberta, where he established and became
publisher of the “Lethbridge Herald,” first as a weekly and, in 1907,
changed it to a daily. For two years he was President of the Alberta and
Eastern British Columbia Press Association, and Director of the Western
Associated Press. He entered politics in 1909, in the Liberal interests,
and was elected as the first member to represent Lethbridge City in the
Alberta Legislature, and became a member of the Rutherford Government in
the fall of the same year. In 1911 he resigned, over a difference of
opinion on a railway bargain, and then contested the Constituency of
Medicine Hat for the House of Commons, defeating the late member, C. A.
McGrath (Conservative) by a majority of 1,500. Mr. Buchanan was a member
of the Special House of Commons Committee on old age pensions and on
redistribution. In the general elections of 1917 he was a candidate as a
Unionist Liberal, and was elected by a majority of several thousand. He
is now Unionist Whip for Alberta. In 1918 he was a member of the party
of Canadian Journalists invited to visit the Western front and Great
Britain. During the war he was actively engaged in patriotic movements,
more especially the Patriotic Fund and Belgian Relief Fund. While living
in Ontario, Mr. Buchanan took a great interest in military affairs and
became Quartermaster of the 25th Regiment, at St. Thomas. He is
interested in all kinds of sports and takes a keen pleasure in golf; was
Secretary and Treasurer of the Ontario Hockey Association during John
Ross Robertson’s Presidency, and was the first Chairman of the Board of
Governors of the Alberta Amateur Athletic Association; is a member of
the Chinook and the Country Clubs of Lethbridge; Ontario Club, Toronto,
and the Laurentian Club, Ottawa. For two years he was President of the
Canadian Club, of Lethbridge. Mr. Buchanan married Alma Maude Freeman,
daughter of Edwin B. Freeman, of Burlington, Ont., and has one son,
Donald W., born April 9, 1908. He is a member of the Methodist Church.

=Williams, Herbert Hale=, head of the firm of H. H. Williams & Co.,
Toronto, Ont. The name of H. H. Williams is a familiar one in the
Canadian real estate field. For many years now his firm, that of H. H.
Williams & Co., with headquarters in Toronto, Canada, has occupied a
prominent place among the old-established and conservative real estate
businesses of the Dominion. Mr. Williams himself, who is the active head
of the firm, is a native of Toronto. Born on September 21, 1862, he
received his education in the local public schools and the Toronto
Grammar School. For a short time after matriculating from the latter
institution, he studied law in the office of George Morphy, but
presently relinquished the idea of becoming a lawyer in favor of
following a mercantile career. His first employment was obtained in the
office of Taylor Bros., paper manufacturers, Toronto, where for two
years he filled the position of book-keeper. Then he turned his
attention to the lumber business, in the prosecution of which he met
with much success. He succeeded in developing an extensive connection
with the railroads of the country, furnishing them with the timber and
manufactured lumber needed in construction and also built up a
considerable export trade to the United States in clear lumber. In 1886
Mr. Williams withdrew from the lumber business and entered the real
estate field. He founded the firm of H. H. Williams & Co. and began
those operations which have subsequently established his reputation as a
sane, far-sighted and reliable dealer. To give some idea of the extent
and importance of the undertakings which Mr. Williams has handled during
the past few years in Toronto, mention might be made of the following
large transactions, all of which were carried through in their entirety
by the firm of H. H. Williams & Co.: The purchase for the Canadian
Pacific Railway Company of the right-of-way along the Esplanade; the
purchase, also for the C.P.R., of the old Government House property on
King Street, together with three blocks of land extending from Simcoe
Street to Spadina Avenue, south of King Street, in connection with the
establishment of freight terminals; the purchase of the two blocks
bounded by Yonge, Carlton, Church and Alexander Streets, which with
subsidiary properties involved an investment of over five million
dollars; the purchase, on behalf of the Dominion Government, of
properties required for a new general post office, a new railway postal
station and an enlarged customs house; and the purchase of the two
blocks bounded by Yonge, College, Teraulay and Hayter Streets,
comprising nine acres of land in the very heart of Toronto and forming
one of the most important retail locations in the city.

=Deroche, William Paschal= (Napanee, Ont.), Local Registrar of the
Supreme Court of Ontario, is the son of Paschal and Elizabeth Jane
Deroche, and married on January 1, 1919, Helen Aylesworth Asselstine,
daughter of the late Benjamin Asselstine, of Kingston, Ont. He was born
at Newburgh, Ont., on August 27, 1854, and educated at Newburgh Academy.
After graduation, Mr. Deroche taught school at Deseronto (then Mill
Point) and other places for five years successfully, and began the study
of law in 1878 with his brother, the late H. M. Deroche, K.C., and Judge
Madden, at Napanee, and also with the well-known firm of Beatty,
Blackstock & Co., at Toronto. He was appointed local Registrar of the
Supreme Court of Ontario, Clerk of the County Court and Registrar of the
Surrogate Court in June, 1887, and has been a member of the Public
Library Board in Napanee for several years. Outside of these offices,
however, Mr. Deroche has sought no public honors, devoting his entire
energies and finding his best reward in discharging them to the
satisfaction of the public and the members of his chosen profession. He
is a member of the Anglican Church and a Liberal in politics. Judge
Deroche, W. D. M. Shorey, Barrister, both of Belleville, Ont.; Col.
Alex. P. Deroche, Director of Works and Buildings at Ottawa; and H. M.

Deroche. With the possible exception of Chief Justice Sir Glenholme
Falconbridge, of Toronto, all the Judges of the High Court who were on
the Bench when Mr. Deroche was appointed to his present position, are
dead. His brother, H. M. Deroche, K.C., died March 10, 1916.

=Forster, J. W. L.=, Artist (Toronto, Ont.), was born at Norval, Ont.,
and was educated at the Brampton Grammar School. Of him, an eminent
public man gives us the following: “Canada, though in some senses a
young country, has already produced a group of noted artists, whose
depiction of her landscape and life is helping to make the Dominion
known throughout the world. Among the leaders in this group is John
Wycliffe Lowes Forster, than whom none of our artists has done so much
for our national portraiture. Not only has he painted more of our public
men than any of his contemporaries, but he is the only Canadian artist
who has devoted his whole genius to the painting of portraits. If all
Mr. Forster’s portraits of famous Canadians, which hang in public
buildings and noted homes, were gathered together, they would in
themselves constitute a large national portrait gallery, and this
gallery would be quite representative of the great leaders in all walks
of life. Among our statesmen—Sir John A. Macdonald, Sir Wilfrid
Laurier, Alexander Mackenzie, John Sandfield Macdonald, Sir John
Thompson, Robert Baldwin, Wm. Lyon Mackenzie, William S. Fielding, Sir
George Ross and Sir James P. Whitney, constitute a comprehensive group.
In divinity, such noted personalities as Punshon, Cavan, Carman, Primate
Archbishop Machray, Primate Archbishop Sweatman, Bishop O’Connor,
Milligan, Kellog, Maclaren; in the Judiciary—Chancellors Moss, Boyd,
Meredith and Mulock; in University life—Paxton Young, Geikie, Nelles,
Burwash, Rand, Wallace, Loudon and Galbraith; among noted military
men—Wolfe, Brock, Roberts, Denison, Merritt and Otter; in other
walks—Strathcona, Goldwin Smith, General Booth, Egerton Ryerson, Sir
Sandford Fleming, Senator Cox, Senator Jaffray, MacKenzie King, Sir
Gilbert Parker and George Brown are representative of a brilliant galaxy
preserved to posterity by Forster’s indefatigable genius. Added to his
Canadian clientele, Mr. Forster has in recent years painted many
distinguished portrait subjects in the United States. Born in Halton
County in the middle of the Nineteenth century, of cultivated English
stock, he was reared, like other men of genius, amid the simpler
pursuits of country life, and his pictures are therefore remarkable for
subtle insight into character, and have at the same time the refined
atmosphere of old world culture.”

=Englehart, Joel Lewis= (Toronto, Ont.), Chairman of the Temiskaming and
Northern Ontario Railway (owned by the Province of Ontario), is the son
of Joel and Hannah Englehart, and was born on November 2, 1847, in
Cleveland, Ohio, and received his education there. He arrived in Canada
in January, 1869, and soon afterward engaged in the oil business in
London, Ont., becoming a producer, then a refiner and exporter, with
offices in New York, and in 1881, when only thirty-four years of age,
became Vice-President of the Imperial Oil Co., which position he still
holds. In 1882 he removed to Petrolea, where he became, and still is,
President of the Crown Savings & Loan Company, of Petrolea, and he is
also Vice-President of the London & Western Trusts Co.; Director of the
Bank of Toronto; ex-Governor of Toronto University and President of the
Petrolea Liberal-Conservative Association, in addition to having many
other business interests. In 1891 Mr. Englehart married Charlotte
Eleanor, daughter of the late Thomas Thompson, of Adelaide, Ont., who
died in 1908, and in whose memory he founded the Charlotte Eleanor
Hospital in Petrolea in 1910, which is on the site of his old homestead
and surrounded by thirty-five acres of land. In 1909 he gave an X-Ray
equipment to St. Michael’s Hospital, Toronto, and in the following year
a chime of eleven bells, one of the finest in the Province, to Christ
Church, Petrolea, and it is safe to assume that his private generosity
has more than kept pace with his public benefactions. In March, 1905,
Mr. Englehart was appointed Chairman of the Temiskaming & Northern
Ontario Railway Commission and his success in developing what he is
pleased to call “Greater Ontario” has amply justified the late Sir James
Whitney’s choice in placing him in this responsible position. He has
been accustomed to business on a large scale, involving powers of
comprehension, quick perception and careful calculation, and on his
appointment, turned his ability and experience to good account in the
service of the Province. He is very much interested in the extension of
the road and the development of the vast farming, timber and mining
country it serves, as may be judged from the fact that only eleven times
during the twelve years he has been Chairman of the Commission has he
missed his monthly trip over the road, and only once has he taken a
month’s holiday. He believes that “Greater Ontario” is the biggest asset
Canada has and is firmly convinced that no spot on the continent affords
such opportunity for success as the territory traversed by the T. & N.O.
Railway System and that to which it has not yet extended. In support of
this claim, Mr. Englehart refers to a series of articles published in
the “Globe” of August, 1916, which has previously been somewhat
critical, written by that paper’s farming editor, and giving statistics
to show that the production both in roots and grain per acre in “Greater
Ontario” was far in excess of the best returns in the older sections of
the Province. Mr. Englehart is both the apostle and the prophet of the
North, enthusiastically proclaiming its unrivalled potential
possibilities, and as he is better informed on the subject than any
other man, his statements may be accepted at face value. Mr. Englehart
is an Episcopalian in religion and a Mason. His clubs are the New York,
Toronto, Albany, Empire, Toronto Hunt and Ontario Jockey, and the
London, of London, Ont. Genial, a versatile and convincing
conversationalist, alert and strong willed, he works actively in the
immense field he supervises and takes keen pleasure in its development.

1878, was educated at the Public and High Schools, Harriston, and the
Model School, Guelph, Ontario, and taught school at Hanover, Ontario,
from 1897 to 1898. From 1899 to 1901 he was assistant to C. M. Hayes,
General Manager of the Grand Trunk Railway, Montreal. Arriving in Ottawa
in the latter year he started in business for himself, and to-day is
President of MacKenzie Limited, Manufacturers of Railway and Lumbermen’s
Supplies, 132 to 136 Lyon Street, Ottawa, whose trade extends throughout
Canada and to other parts of the world. From 1903 to 1907 Mr. MacKenzie
served as Lieutenant of Company A, Governor-General’s Foot Guards. His
brother, James David MacKenzie was killed on September 28, 1918, while
fighting at the front in the great World War. Twice before he had been
wounded and had just returned to the front in France when he met his
death. Two brothers, W. M. and Thomas, served King and Country, the
former being gassed and wounded, and a sister, Margaret, served as a
nurse at the Orpington Hospital, England. Mr. MacKenzie in 1901 married
Jean Andrew, daughter of Archibald Andrew, one of Ottawa’s most charming
vocalists, as a result of which he has one son and one daughter. Mr.
MacKenzie’s father and mother, Kenneth and Mary MacKenzie, reside on

=Harkin, James B.=, is one of those successful journalists who have been
selected by the Dominion Government to occupy important positions in the
service of Canada. In appointing Mr. Harkin to the responsible position
of Commissioner of Dominion Parks, the Government of Canada made a happy
selection, and his work in connection with the Government-owned Parks of
Canada—in his descriptive and handsomely printed and illustrated
publications, in his general ability for such work and in his careful
and personal attention to their care and improvement—is well seen in
the vast improvements that have taken place and in the publicity that
they have had. When Hon. Sir Clifford Sifton was Minister of Interior in
1903, he selected Mr. Harkin as his Private Secretary, which office he
held with that distinguished gentleman until the latter resigned his
portfolio in 1905. Hon. Frank Oliver, succeeding Sir Clifford as
Minister of Interior, retained the services of Mr. Harkin until 1911,
when he appointed him to his present position, viz., Commissioner of
Dominion Parks. If anything, Mr. Harkin has proven more competent in his
present position than he was when occupying the position of private
secretary, and that is saying something. Mr. Harkin was born at Vankleek
Hill, Ont., January 30, 1875, and received his education in the Public
School, Vankleek Hill, and at the High School, Marquette, Michigan. He
became connected with the newspaper work in Montreal in 1892 and served
on the staff of the Ottawa “Journal” from 1893 to 1900. Mr. Harkin is

Ottawa Civil Service and the Rivermead Golf Clubs. He is a Roman
Catholic in religion and resides at 138 Lewis Street, Ottawa, Ontario.

Primary and Second-Class Teaching Certificates at the Bowmanville High
School, and at once embarked upon his career as a teacher, taking charge
of the public school at Providence, three miles out of Bowmanville, for
three years. He then entered the course at the Toronto Normal School,

=Finnie, David Maclachan.= The Bank of Ottawa, now amalgamated with the
Bank of Nova Scotia, was established in December 1874, with headquarters
in the Victoria Chambers, Cor. Wellington and O’Connor streets, Ottawa.
Its authorized capital was $500,000 and its paid-up capital $343,875. An
unique happening is connected with the founding of this bank, viz., that
some twelve days before the head office in Ottawa was opened and ready
for business, a branch office was established in Arnprior under the
management of Mr. David Maclachan Finnie, who was then a young man of 25
years and who in 1903, 29 years later, became Assistant General Manager
and in 1916, General Manager, which position he held up to the time,
April 30th, 1919, of its amalgamation with the Bank of Nova Scotia. Mr.
Finnie was, therefore, the first manager of the Bank of Ottawa to do
business with the public in its solitary branch in Arnprior in 1874,
when authorized capital of the bank was $500,000, and the last General
Manager of the bank in 1919, when its Capital was $4,000,000; when its
reserve fund was $4,750,000; when its branches numbered 95; when it had
contributed 228 members of its staff to the great cause of liberty in
the world’s great war; when its total assets were $70,243,000, and its
liabilities $60,539,000, showing a surplus of just under $10,000,000;
and when it was paying the shareholders over 12 per cent. on the par
value of the stock. The Bank of Ottawa, from the start, established a
high character which it always retained. Its management had a reputation
invariably for generous dealings with its clients and never more than of
the late years; and to Mr. Finnie’s affable manner, generous, yet wise,
consideration of its clients’ requirements and his undoubted ability
both as a banker and as a financier, the success achieved by the bank
was considerably attributable. Mr. David Maclachan Finnie was born at
Peterhead, Scotland, July 10th, 1849. He is the son of Robert and Mary
(Smith) Finnie, and was educated in the Parish School, Peterhead. At an
early age he acquired a business and banking experience in the office of
A. & W. Boyd, Solicitors and Agents in the Union Bank of Scotland,
Peterhead; in the office of Secretary, West of Scotland Wholesale
Grocers Association; in the Bank of British North America, London,
England; Montreal, Hamilton and Arnprior. He is a Director of the Home
Building & Savings Association; was elected Vice-President of the Ottawa
Board of Trade in 1909; is Vice-President of the County of Carleton
Protestant Hospital, and in 1919 was elected by acclamation to the
Presidency of the Royal Ottawa Golf Club. At the opening campaign on
behalf of the Canadian Patriotic Fund, Ottawa Branch, he was elected
Honorary Treasurer, and has remained in that position ever since. There
was subscribed over $2,000,000, nearly all of which has been paid in. In
1875 Mr. Finnie married Caroline Nicholson Sterling, daughter of George
Sterling of Hamilton, Ontario. He was President of the Rideau Club for
1911-12-13, and is a member of the Country, Ottawa Golf, Ottawa Hunt
Clubs. In religion Mr. Finnie is an Anglican. His residence is 329

=Pugh, Thomas James=, one of the successful business men of Toronto, was
born in Kidderminster, England, January 8th, 1871, the son of Charles
and Sarah Pugh. He received his first education in public schools in
England, which on his coming to Canada as a boy, was continued by
courses in the public and High Schools here. On leaving school he
adopted commercial pursuits in which he prospered and was finally
enabled to establish himself as a manufacturer of novelties. He is the

=Sutherland, Thomas Fraser, B.Sc., E.M.=, Chief Inspector of Mines for
the Province of Ontario is recognized in his own and other countries as
one of the leading mining engineers of Canada. He is the son of Rev. J.
M. Sutherland, B.A., a prominent Presbyterian clergyman of the Maritime
Provinces, and was born at Pugwash, Nova Scotia, on Feb. 23rd, 1879. His
professional education was received at Queen’s University, Kingston,
Ont., from which he graduated in 1904 as a fully qualified Mining
Engineer with the degree of Bachelor of Science. On graduation he went
to British Columbia and worked in various gold camps of that province
and also of Alaska as a practical miner, assayer, operator and
prospector. For two years he acted as Western representative of a
prominent New York mining firm with important interests in British
Columbia. After six years’ experience on the Pacific coast he returned
to the East in 1910 and was engaged by the Ontario Bureau of Mines in
1911 as Assistant Inspector at Cobalt, Ont., the centre of one of the
great silver districts of the world. Subsequently in 1913 he became
Chief Inspector, and in 1916 was attached as expert to the Royal Ontario
Nickel Commission to enquire into various problems in connection with
that important industry. His duties in this capacity required him to
visit the famous nickel mines of the French colony of New Caledonia,
which are second only to those of Northern Ontario in extent, and also
the nickel fields of Tasmania. In connection with his investigations and
other official duties he is the author of various reports to the Ontario
Government, which are documents of value to those interested in the
mining industry, and is also a contributor to technical journals in
connection with his profession. He is a member of the Canadian Mining
Institute and in religion is a Presbyterian. In 1908 he married Miss
Ethel Young and has three children, Jack Fraser, Gordon McRae, and
Margaret Jean. His home is at 133 St. Leonard’s Ave., Toronto.

=David, Hon. Laurent Olivier=, City Clerk of Montreal since 1892 and for
years prominent in the public life of Quebec, is one of the
distinguished figures in the Senate of Canada. He is a son of the late
Mayor Stanislas David, a farmer and officer of the Canadian Militia, and
Elizabeth Tremblay, his wife. Senator David was born at
Sault-au-Recollect, P.Q., on March 24th, 1840, and educated at Ste.
Therese College, Quebec. He took up the study of law and while yet a
student became identified with journalism as one of the founders of the
newspaper “Le Colonisateur.” In 1870 he in company with M. Mousseau and
Desbarats founded “L’Opinion Publique” an illustrated weekly, of which
he became chief editor, and resigned as such because he refused to take
the responsibility of approving the Pacific scandal. In 1874 he founded
in company with C. Beausoliel, M.P., and edited “Le Bien Public” and
later published “La Tribune.” In the seventies he began to win fame as
the author of many essays and books on French Canadian history, on which
he is perhaps the greatest living authority. These include “Les
Patriotes de 1837-8”; “Portraits et Biographies”; “Histoire du Canada
depuis l’Union”; “Histoire du Canada depuis la Confederation”; “le
Drapeau de Carillon,” a patriotic drama; “Les Deux Papineau”; “Mes
Contemporains,” (memoirs); “Souvenirs et Biographies”; “Laurier et son
temps”; “Melanges Historiques et Litteraires”; “Le Clergé Canadien, sa
mission et son oeuvre,” and other works. For a short time he filled the
position of translator to the Quebec Legislature, which he resigned in
1878 and subsequently practised law in Montreal. In 1892 he became City
Clerk of Montreal and helped to revise the new charter of that city,
drafted in 1898. He served as President of the great French-Canadian
patriotic Society of St. Jean Baptiste in 1887-8, and his pen and tongue
have always been active in movements for Canadian unity and for the
intellectual advancement of his own people. He was one of the important
delegates to the Convention of the French-Canadian people at Nashua, New
Hampshire, in 1888, and was one of the prime movers in securing the
erection of the Monument National at Montreal and also that for a
monument to Montcalm in France. Originally a Conservative in politics he
left that party to join L’Union Nationale, in the sixties, an
organization formed to oppose Confederation. Later his ideas on that
subject mellowed and Confederation having become an accomplished fact,
he threw in his lot with the newly-formed Liberal party of Dorion,
Holton and Laflamme. His independence of spirit was shown, however, in
the fact that he favored the policy of protection for native industries
in opposition to his party friends. Because of his attitude on that
question he was obliged to discontinue the publication of the “Bien
Public.” From the first entry of Sir Wilfrid Laurier into politics he
became his friend, counsellor and supporter, and during the lifetime of
that statesman no living man enjoyed more of the confidence of the
Liberal chieftain. His entry into politics ante-dated that of his friend
by a few years for he was an unsuccessful candidate for the Quebec
Legislature in Hochelaga in 1867 and later in 1875. From 1886 to 1890 he
represented Montreal East in that body, when he voluntarily retired,
owing to differences with Hon. Honore Mercier, Liberal Leader in the
Legislature. He had several bills adopted by the Legislature in order to
improve the condition of the workingman, and especially to prevent the
seizure of his furniture and wages. He was twice an unsuccessful
candidate for the House of Commons, first in Hochelaga at the general
elections of 1878 and in Montreal East at the general elections of 1891.
He in 1903 was called to the Senate of Canada by the Governor-General,
the Earl of Minto, on the advice of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, and is
recognized as one of the sagest and most able debaters in that body. He
had earlier declined appointment as Lieutenant-Governor of the Northwest
Territories, though pressed to accept by Sir Wilfrid. He is prominently
identified with welfare movements like the society for the Protection of
women and children, Quebec; and the Anti-Alcoholic League, Montreal. He
is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada and a Knight of the Legion of
Honor of France (to which he was appointed in 1911.) His attachment to
the British flag as well as to the interests of his own people has been
the theme of many of his utterances. He is a Roman Catholic and was
twice married; first in 1886 to Albina Chenet (died July, 1887);
secondly to Ludivine Garceau (died, February, 1915). He has had one son
and nine daughters.

=Dollard, Rev. James B.=, is one of the most distinguished lyric poets
of the day, whose residence in this country must be regarded as
fortunate for the cause of Canadian letters, though he is not a native
of this country. He was born in Kilkenny County, Ireland, on August
30th, 1872, the son of Michael Dollard a farmer and Anastasia (Quinn)
Dollard. He was not without Canadian connections, however, since a grand
uncle, Bishop Dollard of Fredericton, N.B., had had a distinguished
career in the Roman Catholic Church in this country. His early education
was received in Kilkenny and he later qualified for admission to the
priesthood at the Grand Seminary, Montreal, Canada. He holds the
scholastic degrees of Bachelor of Theology, Bachelor of Canon Law, and
Doctor of Letters (Laval University). He was ordained as a priest in
1896 and his later years have been spent in the city of Toronto, where
he is now parish priest of St. Monica’s Church, 44 Broadway Avenue.
Despite the duties of a hard-working clergyman, zealous for the welfare
of his parish, he has employed his limited leisure in literary activity
which has won him fame on both sides of the Atlantic. He has published
three volumes of poems and one book of short stories. His literary work
is nearly all Irish in theme and inspiration; for he has never forgotten
the happy days he spent as a lad in the beautiful isle that holds the
enduring love of so many patriots, whose duties have called them far
from its shores. The growth of his fame as a lyric poet is the more
notable in that he is of modest, retiring nature and has never sought
publicity of any kind. Irish legend and Irish scenery are woven by him
into the most delicate and rhythmical verse—verse that is instinct with
music, and alive with lovely imagery. One tribute to him from the pen of
the late Joyce Kilmer, himself a poet of distinction and prior to his
death with the American troops at Chateau Thierry, the literary critic
of the New York “Times,” may be quoted. Of the poem “Fairy Anvils” which
appears in the volume entitled “Irish Lyrics and Ballads,” Kilmer wrote:
“Here is some genuine Celtic magic—a beautiful blend of melody and
fancy. It should be set to music—the words almost carry a tune with
them—and sung by John McCormack.” The same tribute could be paid to
many other lyrics by Father Dollard. He is a member of the Poetry
Society of America and of the Arts and Letters Club, Toronto.

=Drysdale, William=, Appraiser with His Majesty’s Customs, Montreal,
Que., was born in that city, April 17th, 1847. His father, Adam
Drysdale, a native of Dunfermline, Scotland, settled in Canada during
the first half of the nineteenth century and for a long period held a
post in the civil service conferred on him by Lord Elgin, during the
period when that celebrated British pro-consul was Governor of the old
Province of United Canada. The father of Adam Drysdale was one of the
first persons to engage in the shipping trade between Canada and
Scotland and was one of the earliest shippers to make use of the Port of
Montreal. The subject of this sketch was educated at Montreal in the
private school of Mr. Hicks (who later became the first principal of the
Normal School in that city), and received a thorough commercial
training. On leaving school he entered the employ of the late John
Dougall, who was at that time publishing the “Weekly Witness” and also
engaged in the book business. The aptitude of young Drysdale was such
that he was almost immediately placed by Mr. Dougall in charge of the
book department. After a short time his services were sought by Mr.
Grafton, another bookseller, with whom he remained as confidential
manager until 1874 when he founded a book business of his own, which
became a celebrated institution in Montreal. Owing to his excellent
training and personal popularity he soon built up a business second to
none in the Dominion. Mr. Drysdale also rendered a public service in
publishing a number of Canadian works which are now of great historic
value. Later he retired from business to accept his present post with
the Customs Service. As a citizen he gave his support to all movements
looking to public betterment, and to philanthropic institutions. He is a
Life Governor of the Boys’ Home and a member of the executive of the
Natural History Society, Prison Aid Association, Charitable Committee of
St. Andrew’s Society Canadian Club, Montreal Art Association, Imperial
Home Re-union Association, Numismatic and Antiquarian Society. He is a
life member of the Mechanics’ Institute, Governor of the Montreal
Dispensary, and one of the most active supporters of the Protestant Home
for the Insane. He has long been a member of the Montreal Board of Trade
and an elder of the Presbyterian Church, who has frequently been
commissioner to the General Assembly. Mr. Drysdale was first married in
1880 to Miss Mary Maltbee Wales, daughter of the late Charles Wales,

sums up Mr. Drysdale’s character in the following lines:—

        Some are while careful of their own affairs,
          And when successfully amassing wealth,
          Who oft-times will withdraw, as if by stealth
        To render good to others unawares.
        Well known to them the haunts of poverty.
          Clothed are the naked, and the hungry fed,
          Oft take they place beside the patient’s bed
        To cheer sad hours; to soothe keen agony.
        These are earth’s salt—they labor with a mind,
          Distress relieving, lessening human woe;
          In all their actions earnest, gentle, kind,
        Leaving sweet impress whereso’er they go.
        Theirs Heaven’s reward; a crown upon each brow,
        Warm hearted DRYSDALE! such a man art thou!

=McQuarrie, William Garland, K.C.=, M.P. for New Westminster, B.C., is
regarded as one of the most able and aggressive of the younger members
of the Canadian House of Commons. He was born at Ottawa, July 26th,
1876, the son of Lachlan and Mary McQuarrie. When he was but a child his
father, who was a prominent contractor, moved to the West, residing
first at Winnipeg and later at New Westminster; and the education of the
subject of this sketch was obtained at the public and high schools of
those cities. Subsequently he studied law at Osgoode Hall, Toronto, and
was called to the Bar of British Columbia in 1900. He first practised at
Ashcroft, B.C., with Mr. Denis (now Mr. Justice) Murphy, but returning
to New Westminster in 1902, became a member of the firm of Morrison,
Whiteside, McQuarrie & Briggs, of which the senior partner was Mr. (now
Mr. Justice) Morrison. Later the firm became known as Martin, Weart &
McQuarrie, and was headed by Hon. Joseph Martin, K.C., for a time
Premier of British Columbia and afterward a member for St. Pancras in
the British House of Commons. Subsequently Mr. F. C. Wade, K.C., the
present Agent-General of British Columbia in London, became head of the
firm, which was then known as Wade, Whealler, McQuarrie & Martin. In
1912 Mr. McQuarrie founded his present firm which is known as McQuarrie,

represented his city and other municipalities in a demand on the
Canadian Northern Railway for back taxes, in which nearly a quarter of a
million dollars was involved and in which he was victorious. He has also
figured as counsel in several important murder and treason trials as
Crown Counsel. In the latter capacity he has acted very frequently ever
since 1904 and his abilities as a criminal lawyer have proven
exceptional. In January of the present year (1919) he was created King’s
Counsel by the Oliver Government though an opponent of it in politics.

Westminster Federal Conservative Association in 1916 and 1917. In the
latter year he accepted the Unionist nomination for New Westminster and

regarded as a coming man in Canadian politics. His chief recreation is
golf and he is a member of the Westminster Club; the Vancouver Club;

=Cousineau, Joseph Philemon, B.A., K.C., LL.D.=, of the firm of
Cousineau and Lacasse, advocates, 90 St. James Street, Montreal, was
born at St. Laurent, Quebec, in 1874, and is one of the many brilliant
Canadians of French affiliations who have done so much to enrich the
legal history of Canada. He is the son of Gervais and Angelique
Cousineau and was educated at Ste. Therese College, and at Laval
University, where he secured his B.A. in 1894, his LL.L. in 1896 and his
LL.D. in 1901. He read law with J. Beauchamp and with C. R. Charles
Bruchesi. He was called to the Quebec Bar in 1896 and was created King’s
Counsel in 1909. Like many of his compatriots Mr. Cousineau united law
and politics. He began his political career as mayor of St. Laurent, an
office he held from 1904 to 1908. In that year he resigned his mayoralty
to become member of the Quebec Legislature for the district of Jacques
Cartier. He was re-elected in 1912 and in 1915 and 1916 was leader of
the opposition at Quebec. His authorship in 1901 of a brilliant thesis
“Des Corporations” was possibly one of the determining influences in his
appointment to the professorship of “Droit Administrative” at Laval
University, a position he has held since 1903. He is also a member of
the Canadian and the Chapleau Clubs. In 1897 Mr. Cousineau married
Helmina, daughter of L. S. Gendron. He has four daughters, Aline,
Gilberte, Jeanne and Gabrielle. In politics he is a Conservative, and in
religion a Roman Catholic. He still maintains the family residence at
St. Laurent.

=Cutten, George Barton=, of Wolfeville, Nova Scotia, president Acadia
University, is one of the interesting Canadians who have won educational
honor in their own country. Dr. Cutten was born at Amherst, Nova Scotia,
on April 11, 1874. His parents were William Herman Cutten and Abbie Ann
Trefry, and their early training was doubtless responsible for their
son’s brilliant career. At twenty-two he won his B.A. degree from
Acadia, the university he was afterwards destined to govern as
president; at twenty-three he was B.A. at Yale, and from then on he won
in rapid succession his M.A. at Acadia, his Ph.D. at Yale, his B.D. at
Yale, his D.D. at Colgate and his LL.D. at Acadia. In 1898 Dr. Cutten
married Minnie W. Brown, daughter of John Ingerson Brown and Sophia
Zwicker of Westfield, Mass., and his four children are Margarita Joy,
born in 1902; Muriel Grace, born in 1904; Claire, born in 1906 and
William Francis, born in 1908. Dr. Cutten is a member of two Greek
letter fraternities, the Phi Sigma Delta, and the Phi Beta Kappa, is a
Baptist in religion and an Independent in politics, but he is not a
Pacifist, for he has held two military commissions—Captain in the 219th
Battalion, and Major in the 246th. Dr. Cutten is the author of a number
of interesting books: “The Psychology of Alcoholism” (Walter Scott
Publishing Company, London), “The Psychological Phenomena of
Christianity,” and “Three Thousand Years of Mental Healing,” both
published by Scribner’s, New York; “The Case of John Kinsel”
(Psychological Review), and “The Christian Life in a Baptist Church”
(Marriott Press, Corning, New York.).

=Goring, C. C.=, manufacturer, of 172 Markland Street, Hamilton,
Ontario, is a self-made man, and proud of it. He furnishes one of the
numerous cases we have in Canada of the farmer’s son who gets well up
the ladder by persistent, well-directed efforts along one line of
business. Commencing as an oil salesman on “the road,” Mr. Goring
eventually had charge of the sales force of a large refinery in New York
State. From that he went into the jobbing and export department and
eventually he incorporated a company which has done a successful
business both in the United States and in Canada. He is now president
and managing director of the Ontario Lubricating Company, Limited. Mr.
Goring was born at Homer, Ontario, on March 31, 1878, his parents being
Ransom Goring and Melissa Cushman. He received a Canadian public school
education and went directly from school into business. On January 2,
1907, he married Edith Wildman, daughter of Edwin Wildman, Hamilton,
Ontario. He has two children, Gladys Irene, born February 15, 1909, and
Gordon Hamilton, born January 27, 1915. Mr. Goring is a Protestant, a

=Dinnick, Lieut.-Col. Wilfrid Servington=, one of the leading financiers
and public men of Toronto, was born at Guildford, England, on July 19th,
1874, the son of (Rev.) John Dunn and Charlotte Matilda Dinnick. He was
educated at York School, Brighton, Eng., and came to Canada in 1889. In
that year he obtained a position in the office of the Provincial Loan
Company, Toronto, where he remained for two years, joining the Canadian
Birbeck Investment Security and Savings Co., with which corporation he
remained until 1895. By the time he was twenty-one he had acquired
through his natural aptitude for finance a very complete knowledge of
the Canadian investment field and before he was thirty had become a
prominent figure in Toronto financial circles. He is at present
Vice-President of the Standard Reliance Mortgage Corporation, 84 King
St. East, Toronto; and President of the Sterling Trusts Corporation.
Notable among his business achievements was that of founding and
organizing Lawrence Park, one of the exclusive suburban residential
districts of Toronto, which by virtue of the policy which he adopted in
the matter of planning and building restrictions, is one of the beauty
spots of a city renowned for its palatial homes. His services of a
public character became especially noteworthy during the late war. On
Dec. 21st, 1914, he organized the 109th Regiment in which he holds the
rank of Lieut.-Col. This organization largely through the energetic
methods of Col. Dinnick sent to the front over 200 officers and 5000
men, who served chiefly in the 84th and 169th Overseas Battalions and
seven other quotas also. It also contributed the C.D.F. Battalion for
home defence in Canada. As an organizer of public benefactions Col.
Dinnick also showed indefatigable energy and organizing talent. He was
largely instrumental in securing $2,400,000 for the Toronto and York
Patriotic Fund in 1916; and $3,400,000 for the same object in 1917. He
was also the organizer of the British Red Cross Appeal in 1915 and
raised $550,000, which was increased to $740,000 in 1916. He has
likewise willingly given his services to numerous appeals of a minor
character, and many organizations have profited by his unique abilities
in that field. He has been active in support of schemes of civic
improvement and was the originator of the Back Garden development idea
in Toronto, which has been blessed with excellent results. He is a
Conservative in politics, a member of St. Paul’s (Anglican) Church,
Toronto, and is Honorary Secretary of the Canadian Council of the Pocket
Testament League. His recreations are Motoring and horse-back riding and
he is the President and one of the founders of the Lawrence Park Lawn
Bowling Club. He is also a member of the Albany, National, Toronto Hunt,
Lambton Golf, Rosedale Golf, and Royal Canadian Yacht Clubs, Toronto,
and of the A.F. & A.M. In New York on June 16th, 1905, he married Miss
Alice Louise Conlin and has two sons and two daughters. His residence is
at Bedford Lodge, Toronto.

L’Assomption College, L’Assomption, Quebec. On leaving college about
sixteen years ago he joined the business of his father, who had
established the firm of William Ewing & Co., Wholesale Seedsmen, at

propaganda leading to passing of Children’s Protection Act by Ontario
Government, and under its provision was appointed General Superintendent
of Neglected and Dependent Children, and Inspector of Industrial
Schools. In its initial stages Mr. Kelso had much to do with the
inauguration of the Juvenile Court movement, having addressed the Waif
Saving Congress on the subject at the World’s Fair, Chicago, in October,
1893. He was also one of the first advocates of Widowed Mothers’ Aid and
Workmen’s Compensation Boards. In March, 1898, Mr. Kelso addressed the
Legislature of Manitoba and British Columbia and they unanimously agreed
to adopt the Ontario system of child protection. In 1905 he visited Nova
Scotia with the same successful result; in 1908 Saskatchewan, and in
1913, New Brunswick. All Canada now follows the same methods of carrying
on Child Welfare work, Mr. Kelso having organized over two hundred and
fifty Children’s Aid Societies, in addition to Social Settlements, etc.

=Oliver, Hon. John= (Victoria, B.C.), son of Robert Oliver, of
Derbyshire, England, and Emma Lomas, his wife, of Staffordshire. Was
born on July 31, 1856, at Hartington, Derbyshire, England. In April,
1870, his parents, with eight children, of whom the subject of this
sketch was the eldest, left the Motherland, and eventually settled on a
farm in Wellington County, Ontario. There he worked on his father’s farm
in the summer and went to the woods in the winter, and, in his spare
time, picked up stone masonry. In 1877, the future premier set out for
Victoria B.C., with only a few dollars in his pocket and no particular
job in sight. Twenty-three years later he returned to the capital as a
member of the Legislature, and forty years afterwards he became head of
the Provincial Government. Shortly after going to British Columbia, Mr.
Oliver took up land in the Delta municipality, and to-day he is the
proprietor of one of the finest farms in the province. Mr. Oliver has
always evinced a genius for public service, and has always taken a keen
and intelligent interest in public questions. He had not been long in
the west before he was elected a member of the Delta Municipal Council,
and was later reeve for several terms. He was first elected to the
British Columbia Legislature at the general elections in 1900, and
re-elected in 1903 and 1907. At the general elections in 1909, as leader
of the Opposition, he contested two constituencies, Victoria and Delta,
and was defeated in both. A similar experience awaited him in 1911, and
again in the campaign in 1912. In 1916, upon the formation of the
Brewster cabinet, he was appointed Minister of Railways and Agriculture.
On the death of Premier Brewster, after one session in office, Mr.
Oliver was called upon by the Lieutenant-Governor to form a Government,
which he did, retaining his former portfolios, besides acting as
Premier. His reputation as a parliamentarian of the first rank was
firmly established by the part he played in the exposure of what was
known as the “Columbia and Western Railway Scandal.” He was chiefly
instrumental in having grants for some 650,000 acres of coal mining land
in the Kootenay district cancelled. Premier Oliver was married on June
20, 1886, to Elizabeth, daughter of William Woodward, of Mud Bay,
British Columbia. He is the father of the following children: Robert,
William Arthur, John Thomas, Charles Edward, Joseph, Elizabeth Alice,
Sarah Ellen, Mildred Emma. Premier Oliver has for years been known as
“Honest John,” and his long record for probity and fair dealing justly
entitles him to this distinction. Although somewhat handicapped in early
life by lack of scholastic training, the Premier was by nature a
student, and he became a wide reader. He is a man of rugged honesty,
industrious and aggressive, and enjoys a measure of public confidence
which is indicated by the title conferred upon him by the people of his
province. The Premier’s candour and courage are recognized as his
greatest assets, while his long association with public affairs and
foremost position in the Liberal party has made his name a household
word in British Columbia. The Premier possesses sufficient property,
acquired by his own industry, to make him independent of political
fortunes. He is undoubtedly one of the most interesting and picturesque
figures in Canadian public life.

Catharines to accept a similar position with H. Patterson & Co. In 1884
he was promoted to the position of office and business manager and in
1893, when the firm name was changed to E. H. Phelps & Co., he purchased
a partnership interest in the business and continued to act as business
manager. In 1901, when the enterprise was re-organized and incorporated
as the Canada Wheel Works, Ltd., he became its President and General
Manager. In 1914 another change was effected when an amalgamation was
arranged with the Windsor Turned Goods Co., Ltd., and the new
corporation became known as the Canada Pole and Shaft Co., Ltd., of
which Mr. Hara was appointed and still is President. His other business
and industrial interests are extensive. He is President of the St.
Catharines Steel and Metal Company, Ltd.; Vice-President of the Marathon
Tire & Rubber Co., Ltd.; President of the United Gas Co., Ltd.; a
Director of Industrials, Ltd., St. Catharines; a Director of the Port
Arthur Wagon and Implements Co., Ltd.; and is also interested as a
shareholder in many other companies. During the recent war his business
energy was sought in connection with Red Cross and Patriotic Funds and
he became an ardent worker and supporter of them, and was a member of
the local executive in connection therewith. Though on many occasions
his fellow citizens have desired that he take public office, his only
experience of the kind was thirty years ago when he served two years as
a school trustee at Merritton. His recreations are motoring and golf,
and he is a Past President of the St. Catharines Club; Vice-President
(1918) of the St. Catharines Golf Club and a member of the Laurentian
Club, Ottawa. He is also a member of the A.F. & A.M., and is a Liberal

=Hough, John Atwell= (Matheson, Ont.), Police Magistrate, was born in
Ireland in 1882, and received his early education in England and
Scotland, but migrated to Canada at an early age. He was appointed
Mining Recorder, Larder Lake Mining Division, with headquarters at
Larder Lake, Ont., in March, 1907; four years later, however, the
boundaries of the Division were enlarged and the head office moved to
Matheson, where he now resides. As Police Magistrate for the Town of
Matheson and part of the District of Temiskaming, Mr. Hough was placed
in charge of all relief work from Ramore to Porquis Junction, after the
great fire which devastated Northern Ontario on July 29, 1916, and many
stricken families have reason to be thankful for the energy and public
spirit with which he discharged this difficult task. John Hough is a
Conservative in politics and a member of the Masonic Order. By his wife,
Myrtle, daughter of M. Donaghue of Windsor, Ont., he has two children.

=Fifield, Albert Frank= (St. Catharines, Ont.), was born at Lowell,
Mass., on Feb. 8, 1876. Son of Frank and Abie Mary (Cummings) Fifield,
of Ashland, N.H. Educated at the Public Schools of New Hampshire and
commenced his business career operating a machine shop in Ashland, in
1896. This he continued until 1905, when he accepted a position as
Construction Superintendent of the Jenckes Machine Company, Quebec, and
has ever since been a resident of Canada. In 1907 he set up business at
St. Catharines and engaged in buying and selling machinery until 1910.
He established the Reo Sales Company for the sales of Reo motor cars in
Canada, and, during this period, organized and fully carried out a coast
to coast motor trip in a Reo car. This was the first trip of the kind
made in Canada and Mr. Fifield furnished the car and men. In 1914 he
organized and became the first General Manager of the Metal Drawing
Company, Ltd., of St. Catharines. In pursuance of his policy of building
up new industries in the city of his adoption, Mr. Fifield, when the
demand came for shells from the British War Office, sold out his other
interests and engaged in the manufacturing of munitions on a large scale
with great success. In fact, he was one of the most prominent figures in
this industry during the Great War. He also organized the American
Patriotic Fund among former residents of the United States living in St.
Catharines, part of whose revenues were subsequently diverted to the
associated charities of the city, of which he was for a time chairman
and is now a member of the executive. He also served as a member of the
Executive Committee of the Local Branch of the Canadian Patriotic Fund.
He is Independent in politics, a Protestant in religion and a member of

=Wright, Harry George= (Hamilton, Ont.), Manufacturer, is the surviving
partner and President of the E. T. Wright Company, Ltd., Tinware,
founded in 1883, Mr. E. T. Wright having died in 1908, with whose
passing the firm suffered the loss of a man whose practical knowledge
and mechanical ability had done much to lay the foundations of the
present flourishing business. Mr. H. G. Wright is well known throughout
Canada, having represented the firm for many years on the road, where
the many friends made in his younger days still know him best as
“Harry.” Energetic and aggressive, he has always been the life of the
concern since its inception. Coming as he does of good Devonshire
fighting stock, it is not surprising to find that two of Mr. Wright’s
sons are taking an active part in the Great War. Captain George Craig
Wright, Vice-President of the firm, has just returned from the front,
having served from the first and being the first officer to enlist in
the Fourth Battalion of the City of Hamilton in 1914. He was the only
officer of that battalion left at the battles of Langemarcke and Ypres,
who was not either wounded, captured or killed. For efficient conduct he
was promoted to his present rank and, although home on furlough, is
acting as Brigade Major to the Sixth Brigade on the Niagara Peninsula.
Mr. Gordon Wright, the Treasurer, has received his commission as a
Lieutenant in the Thirteenth Royals. The subject of this sketch was born
at Bethany, Pa., December 11, 1855, the son of Thomas W. Wright, and
came to Hamilton five years later, where he received his education in
the Public School and Commercial College. In 1889 he married the
daughter of George Craig, of R. Hay & Company, Toronto, Ont., and has
five children—George Craig, Kate, H. Gordon, Phyllis and Jack Edwin.
Mr. Wright is a Liberal in politics and a Methodist in religion. His
recreations are golf and bowling, and he is a member of the following
clubs: Hamilton, Commercial, Royal Yacht and Victoria Curling, all of
Hamilton, and the Ontario, of Toronto.

=Innes, Hugh Patterson, K.C.=, Barrister-at-Law of Simcoe, Ont., is a
prominent figure in the politics of Western Ontario. He is a son of
William P. and Marion (Livingstone) Innes and was born at Dundas, Ont.
on Sept. 14th, 1870. His father is an eminent manufacturer and
capitalist who was one of the pioneers of the canning industry in this
country, and is now a Director of Dominion Canners, Limited. The subject
of this sketch was educated at the public and High schools of Simcoe,
Norfolk county, and studied for the legal profession at Osgoode Hall,
Toronto. He was called to the Bar of Ontario on graduation in 1893, and
has since practised at Simcoe, where he acts as Town solicitor and legal
adviser for the Molsons Bank, Dominion Canners, Ltd., and other
important institutions. He has also been a public and High school
trustee for the town and was made a King’s Counsel in 1908. In the
latter year he was the candidate of the Conservative party at the
general elections for the Ontario Legislature and was elected.
Subsequently he voluntarily resigned his seat to become the candidate of
his party for the House of Commons in the Federal riding of Norfolk and
was nominated in the spring of 1915, the date of the contest at that
time being uncertain. In the autumn of 1917, however, after Union
Government was formed it was necessary for Sir Robert Borden to ask
certain Conservative candidates to make the sacrifice of withdrawing
from the field in order to permit the election of prominent Liberals who
had given their support to Union Government. Mr. Innes was one of these
and his course in stepping aside assured the election of Hon. W. A.
Charlton as a Liberal-Unionist representative of Norfolk. Nevertheless
his election to the Commons at some future day may be regarded as a
certainty. Mr. Innes is a Presbyterian and a member of the following
lodges: Norfolk No. 10; A.F. & A.M. and Past Master Ezra Chapter, No.
23; Royal Arch Masons. On June 29th, 1898, he married Mabel M., daughter
of His Honor Judge Livingstone of Norfolk County and has eight children,
Margaret Livingstone; Hugh Paterson, Jr.; Robert T. L.; Helen M.;
Constance M.; Grace L.; James S.; and Edith V. Innes.

=Williams-Taylor, Sir Frederick, LL.D.= (Montreal, Que.), General
Manager Bank of Montreal, is one of the outstanding figures in the
financial world of Canada. During his eight years as Manager of the
Bank’s London, England Branch, Sir Frederick was notably successful in
financing many Canadian municipal and corporate undertakings in that
market. Recently his abilities have been devoted to war-time financing
in Canada. On both sides of the Atlantic, therefore, he has had wide
experience in the flotation of high-class Canadian issues. In addition
to being expert in all financial matters, Sir Frederick is possessed of
marked personality and exceptional social charm. Born at Moncton, New

first elected to the House of Commons at a by-election, December 3,
1902, to fill the vacancy caused by the appointment of Mr. Thomas B.
Flint as Clerk of the House of Commons. The fact that the late member
for Yarmouth County was elected to the House of Commons at Ottawa for a
fourth term, with the largest majority ever given a candidate from that
Constituency, testified to the esteem in which he was held by those who
knew his worth. Mr. Law married Agnes M., daughter of Capt. Joseph B.
Lovett, and had an only child, Dorothy I. Law. He was a Methodist in
religion and a Liberal in politics.

=Norcross, Joseph W.= (Montreal, Que.), is one of the chief factors in
the Canadian shipping industry, and though still in his forties has
built up a very important position for himself in the Canadian business
world. He was born at Port Colborne, Ont., on May 14th, 1871, the son of
Samuel R. and Susan (Deeks) Norcross. His father was engaged in Lake
transportation and the subject of this sketch after an education at Port
Colborne public school and Welland High School, himself entered the same
calling. As a mere boy from 1890 to 1892 he ran his own boat, S.S.
Varuna on the Bay of Quinte. As he grew older he gradually increased his
interests in connection with transportation on the Great Lakes; on
extensive amalgamations being effected in 1913, became Vice-President
and Managing Director of the Canada Steamships, Ltd., the most important
shipping corporation on Canadian Inland waters, which has much to do
with the handling of this country’s grain crop, and is also a dominant
factor in passenger traffic. In addition to the offices named he is
President of the Canadian Chadwick Metals Co., Ltd.; Vice President of
the Canada West Coast Navigation Co., Ltd. of British Columbia;
Vice-President of the Collingwood Shipbuilding Co., Ltd.; Director of
the Canadian Vickers, Ltd.; Director of the Sterling Bank of Canada; and
Director of the Cluff Ammunition Co., Ltd. During the late war the
Government availed itself of his expert talents by appointing him a
Director of ship construction in connection with the Naval Service
Department. In that capacity he rendered very valuable service to the
Canadian community and refused to accept remuneration therefor. He is
recognized by transportation men everywhere as one of the leading
shipping experts of this continent. He is widely known in all the cities
of the Great Lakes and a member of many clubs including the Albany and
National (Toronto); Travellers’ (London); Montreal and St. James

=McCarthy, Jesse Overn= (Toronto, Ont.), Vice-President and General
Manager of the Security Life Insurance Co. of Canada, has been somewhat
prominently connected for twenty-five years with the life insurance
business of the Dominion and in the field of Social Welfare and Moral
Reform. Nearly thirty years ago he began giving addresses on Child
Welfare Problems and on different phases of Social Welfare work and
legislation, when to speak on these matters was like “a voice crying in
the wilderness,” and has seen the objects which he so strongly advocated
accomplished to a remarkable extent in legislative and practical effort
by the city and province alike. During that time he has given over two
thousand addresses before churches, Canadian Clubs and municipal
organizations. His entry into the municipal life of Toronto, first as
alderman and then as Controller, was due to the adverse conditions
prevailing at that time in the Isolation Hospital and his desire to see
a thoroughly up-to-date and efficient Health Department established.
Outside authorities and those familiar with the situation have stated
that he was able to strongly interest and influence the Council in all
health and social problems, so that splendid progress was made during
the time that he was connected with that body. A Methodist in religion
and a Liberal in politics, Mr. McCarthy served as Alderman of the City
of Toronto, 1910-1911, and as Controller, 1912-1914. He is a member of
the Board of Trade, the Sons of Temperance, the Royal Templars of
Temperance, the Canadian Order of Foresters, and the Protestant
Benevolent Society, as also of Parkdale Canoe and Lawn Bowling Clubs.

Rochester, N.Y., on May 9, 1875, he is of English descent, the son of
Rev. Canon C. J. Machin and Emma M. L. Machin, both of whom were born in
the Motherland. Col. Machin as a child lived in St. John’s,
Newfoundland, and later in Port Arthur, Ontario, in both of which cities
his father served as an Anglican rector. In 1885 he was sent to England
to be educated at The School House, Beaconsfield, Bucks county. He
returned to Canada in 1893, and to Rat Portage, now Kenora; that town,
despite many prolonged absences, has ever since been his home. He
qualified for the law at Osgoode Hall, Toronto, and, after being called
to the bar, practised in Kenora, and soon became widely known through
that region of far western Ontario. Identifying himself with the
Conservative party, he was first elected to the Legislature in 1908, and
subsequently returned at the general elections of 1911 and 1914. From
early manhood he showed military enthusiasm, and went to South Africa in
1899 as a private in the 1st Canadian contingent under Col. (now Sir
William) Otter. He served as private and n.c.o. until 1901, when he was
given a commission in the South African Constabulary. In 1904 he retired
with the rank of Captain, and returned to Canada, after which he spent
the open seasons of the three successive years in prospecting for
minerals in the Chibogomo and Mistissini districts of Northern Quebec.
When the great war broke out, the old spirit of patriotism and adventure
came over him again, and in 1915 he raised and became the O.C. of the
94th Battalion, with headquarters at Port Arthur. He went overseas with
his Battalion in 1916, and shortly after his arrival in England was
directed to raise and command the Canadian Labor Battalion for service
in France. He went to the fighting area with this battalion, and served
six months at the advanced base and with the 4th British Army between
Peronne and St. Quentin. In 1917, he returned to Canada on leave, and
was retained for duty as a member of the Military Service Council,
established in connection with the Military Service Act. On the
completion of the work of the Military Service Council in 1918, Col.
Machin became Director of the Military Service Branch of the Department
of Justice, under arrangement with the Department of Militia and
Defence. Both as a legislator and a judicial officer, Col. Machin has
shown a fearlessness and ability in the expression of opinion that have
commended him to persons of independent mind, even when in disagreement
with him. He was one of the few men in the Ontario Legislature with the
moral courage to assail the defects of the Ontario Temperance Act,
though it was fathered by the government of which he is the elected
supporter. His strong utterances against a bigoted attitude toward the
French Canadians of Quebec and Roman Catholics in general, coming from a
Protestant of English descent and education, have also been widely
commended. On December 24, 1918, he was the recipient of an address and
silver rose bowl from the officials who served with him and under him as
Director of Military Service in the Department of Justice at Ottawa.
Their sentiments were voiced by Crown Attorney J. A. Ritchie, who
referred to him as their “guide, counsellor and friend.” He is a capital
speaker, and in the Ontario Legislature his speeches are always hailed
with interest. He is an adherent of the Church of England, and a member
of the Toronto Club, Albany Club, Toronto Military Institute, and the
Canadian Mining Institute. He is also a Fellow of the Royal Geographical
Society of England. On December 8, 1902, he married Miss Ida F. Knight,
of Horner Grange, West Hill, Sydenham, England, and has two daughters,
Ida A. K., born Bloemfontein, South Africa, December 7, 1903, and
Barbara K., born Kenora, Ont., January 7, 1914. Though of late years his
duties have carried Col. Machin far afield, his permanent residence is
at Kenora, Ont.

=Dalton, Hon. Charles, M.P.P.=, Minister without portfolio in the

He was born at Tignish, P.E.I., on June 9, 1850, the son of Patrick and
Margaret (McCarthy) Dalton, and was educated in the public schools. His
father was a farmer, and the son has been especially identified with the
raising of black foxes for the fur trade. He engaged in this business
upwards of twenty years ago in a legitimate way, before it became a
field for reckless speculators, and has bred some of the most valuable
foxes in the world. He is President of the Charles Dalton Silver Black
Fox Company, Ltd., one of the pioneer companies in this industry. He
first entered politics 1900, when he was an unsuccessful candidate for
the Prince Edward Island Legislature. Subsequently, in 1912, he was
elected for Prince constituency, and became a member without portfolio
in the Mathieson ministry, since which he has spent a considerable part
of his time at the capital, Charlottetown. Hon. Mr. Dalton is one of the
leading capitalists and philanthropists of his province. He gave a
donation of $60,000 for the erection of a tuberculosis sanitarium at
North Wiltshire, P.E.I., and also a benefaction of $55,000 to St.
Dunstan’s University, P.E.I. Another of his public gifts was that of the

=Perley, Sir George Halsey= (Ottawa, Ont.), Acting High Commissioner for
Canada in England, and Overseas Minister of Militia and Defense in the
Cabinet of Sir R. L. Borden, Premier of Canada, is the son of the late
W. G. Perley, who represented Ottawa in the House of Commons from 1887
to 1890, and was senior member of the well-known lumber firm of Perley &
Pattee. Sir George Perley was born at Lebanon, N.H., in 1857, but coming
to Ottawa in early youth, received his primary education at the old
Grammar School of that city, and later attended Harvard University, from
which he graduated in 1878 with the degree of B.A. In 1900 the present
Cabinet Minister contested the County of Russell unsuccessfully, and was
also unsuccessful in a by-election for the County of Argenteuil, held in
1902. Perseverence, however, and the ability which marked these
campaigns led to his return for the latter County at the General
Elections of 1904, since when he has been twice re-elected in 1908 and
1911. On the re-organization of the Conservative Party Executive, during
its last session in Opposition, Sir George Perley was chosen as Chief
Whip, in which capacity he showed such tact and ability as Mr. Borden’s
Chief Lieutenant, and also in directing the organization for the Ottawa
Valley District during the Reciprocity Campaign, that the latter, on his
accession to power, appointed him a Minister Without Portfolio. After
the death at an advanced age of Lord Strathcona and Mount Royal in 1913,
Mr. Perley was sent to England to replace him, with the title of Acting
High Commissioner for the Dominion of Canada, a position which he has
since filled with such distinction as to earn for him the honor of
Knighthood. In the re-organization of the Department of Militia and
Defense, following the resignation of Sir Sam Hughes, Sir George became
the first Overseas Minister of that Department. He has been for years a
Director and Vice-President of a number of large lumber companies, and
is a Director of the Bank of Ottawa. Nowhere, however, has his executive
ability been more strikingly displayed than in his discharge of the
duties of Chairman of the Relief Committee in connection with the
disastrous fire of 1900 that devastated the cities of Ottawa and Hull.
Sir George Perley married Annie Hespeler Bowlby, daughter of the late W.
H. Bowlby, K.C., Kitchener, Ont., in 1884 (deceased, August, 1910);
secondly, Emily Colby White, daughter of the late Hon. Thomas White,
June 11, 1913.

=Barrow, Hon. Edward Dodsley, M.P.P.=, Minister of Agriculture for the
Province of British Columbia, is one of those Canadians of English birth
who have risen to high position in their adopted country. He was born at
Ringwood, Hants, England, in 1867, the son of Stephen and Sarah (Barnes)
Barrow. His father was a farmer, and the subject of this sketch was
educated at the public schools of his native place. Coming to this
country, he settled at Chilliwack, B.C., and successfully engaged in
farming. He became widely known in his district, and at the general
elections for the legislature in 1916 he was induced to contest
Chilliwack as a Liberal candidate, and was elected. In 1918, Hon. John
Oliver, the present Prime Minister of British Columbia, on accepting
that office, relinquished the ministry of Agriculture, and asked Mr.
Barrow to enter his cabinet as administrator of that portfolio. Mr.
Barrow accepted, and his conduct of the office has brought much
satisfaction to the agricultural interests throughout the province. He
is a protestant in religion, a Liberal in politics, and a member of
Ionic Lodge, No. 19, A.F. & A.M. His favorite recreations are hunting
and fishing. In 1891, he married Millicent E., daughter of Thomas R.
Knight, contracting builder, of Wickham, Hants, England, and has two
daughters, Dorothy M. and Hilda G. Barrow. Though compelled by his
duties to spend much of his time at Victoria, B.C., Mr. Barrow’s home is

=Corrigan, Ambrose Eugene=, is the Managing Director of the Capital Life
Assurance Company, which he organized in 1912, and which, under his able
management, has made rapid advancement in the life assurance business in
Canada, and is now recognized as one of the best and most economically
conducted companies in the Dominion. In 1913, Mr. Corrigan organized the
Capital Trust Corporation, and, in 1914, he organized the Anglo-Colonial
Bureau, London, England. All of these enterprises were organized on a
remarkably firm basis and with much skill, and their success from the
start has more than met with the most sanguine expectation. All of them
are to-day in a flourishing condition, and are growing in both strength
and prestige as they grow older. In that part of western Ontario, now
known as Mount Forest, in the vicinity of Nottawasaga Bay and Lake
Huron, when prairie and forest lands and the adjacent water stretches
were the only attractions, there being no signs of habitation, and no
evidence that, in the near future, even a small settlement would be
established, in 1830, Mr. James Corrigan, the grandfather of the subject
of this sketch, arriving from Ireland, settled, and became the first
settler in that vicinity. With indomitable pluck and spirit
characteristic of his ancestors, he set to work to cultivate the soil,
to build up a home. The next settlers to arrive were the Martins, the
ancestors of Premier Martin of Saskatchewan, and then came others and
others, and more and more land was tilled and houses built until Mount
Forest became a flourishing agricultural and business centre. But it was
James Corrigan who set the ball rolling, and sounded the clarion call to
the others to follow. It was in Mount Forest, May 28, 1881, that Mr.
Ambrose Eugene Corrigan was born, and at the public and high schools
there received his first tuition, which was enlarged at the O.A.C.,
Guelph, Toronto University, and the Ontario Normal School, Hamilton,
Ont. Starting out at the early age of 23 years, Mr. Corrigan, in 1904,
became the teacher of mathematics in the Elora High School. In 1905, he
became attached as a teacher to the Renfrew Collegiate Institute, and,
in 1906, we find him in full harness on the teaching staff of the Ottawa
Collegiate Institute. From 1907 to 1911, Mr. Corrigan was manager of the
Eastern Ontario Branch of the Confederation Life Assurance Company. Mr.
Ambrose Eugene Corrigan is the son of Michael and Ellen (Murphy)
Corrigan. In 1909, he married Rosemary Lunny, daughter of James Lunny,
of Smith’s Falls, Ontario. Five children—three boys and two girls—have
blessed the union. Mr. Corrigan is a Director of the Newman Club,
Toronto, of the Anglo-Colonial Bureau, London, England, and
Vice-President of the Capital Trust Corporation. He is a member of the
Laurentian and the Rivermead Golf Clubs, and of the Knights of Columbus.
Golf is Mr. Corrigan’s favorite recreation. In religion he is a Roman
Catholic. His business office is at 14 Metcalfe Street, and his
residence 301 Laurier Avenue East, Ottawa, Ontario.

=Sloan, Hon. William, M.P.P.=, Minister of Mines for the Province of

on September 10, 1867, the son of Dr. R. J. and Elizabeth (McMichael)
Sloan, and was educated in the public schools and at the Collegiate
Institute, Seaforth, Ont. While he was still a boy, his father removed

in the Orient, the subject of this sketch returned to Canada, locating
in Victoria, British Columbia, in 1887, and later residing at Vancouver
and at Nanaimo, B.C. The mining possibilities of the region soon claimed
his attention, and he was one of the discoverers of the Eldorado Creek
placer gold deposits in the Yukon territory in the later nineties. His
enterprise in that country laid the foundations of a substantial
fortune, and on his return to Victoria, he became Liberal candidate for
the House of Commons for Vancouver Island at the general elections of
1900. He was re-elected both in 1904 and 1908, and became one of the
most popular figures in Ottawa during that period. Shortly after his
election in 1908, he resigned his seat in order that the late Hon.
William Templeman, who had been Appointed Minister of Inland Revenue,
might be elected as his successor. For eight years Hon. Mr. Sloan
remained in retirement, so far as politics were concerned; but in the
political upheaval of 1916 he consented to join forces with those who
were anxious to reform the administration of his province, and was
elected to the British Columbia Legislature for Nanaimo at the general
elections of September 14, 1916. On the formation of a new government,
he was offered, and accepted, the portfolio of Minister of Mines, and
was sworn in on November 29, 1916. His administration has been noted for
progressive business management, and the expert knowledge he is able to

=Lennox, Lieut.-Col. Thomas Herbert, K.C., M.L.A.= (Aurora, Ont.), son
of Thos. and Margaret Lennox, both Irish. Born on April 7th, 1869, at
the Township of Innisfil, County of Simcoe. Educated at the Barrie
Public Schools and Collegiate Institute and Osgoode Hall, Toronto. Was a
member of the Town Council of Aurora for three years and of the Aurora
School Board for six years. Was first elected to the Ontario Legislature
as the member for North York at the general elections in 1905. For years
North York was the stronghold of the Liberal Party and its final
redemption by Lieut.-Col. Lennox gave him an unique place in public
favor and a strong position in Provincial Politics. He was re-elected at
the general election in 1908, 1911 and 1914, and is to-day the most
popular man in the riding. A few years ago the member for North York
originated the “Lennox Picnic” which has been declared to be the biggest
affair of its kind in the world. Up at Jackson’s Point on the beautiful
shores of Lake Simcoe, his constituents and friends hold their annual
gathering of thirty thousand people. Each year the attendance grows
bigger and the people throng to it from all parts and it is now
recognized as being the most popular out-of-door festival of the year.
Lieut.-Col. Lennox has always taken a keen interest in sports of all
kinds, particularly lacrosse, and played the game himself. He was
elected President of the Canadian Lacrosse Association, following which
he was elected President of The Presidents’ Association. As a sound
lawyer and an able counsel, Lieut.-Col. Lennox enjoys a large and
lucrative practice, being solicitor for the County of York, and several
corporations. He is a Bencher of the Law Society of Upper Canada and a
King’s Counsellor. On the outbreak of the war, having had previous
Military experience as Lieutenant of the Twelfth York Rangers and later
a Squadron Commander of the Governor-General’s Body Guard, and
subsequently as Major of an Irish regiment known as the 110th,
authorized by the Minister of Militia, he undertook the raising of an
Irish Canadian Battalion. The onerous work of recruiting began on the
17th day of March, 1915, and no finer body of men ever rallied to the
colors in so short a time. Men flocked to the standard of the popular
member for North York, and the battalion, which was known as the 208th
or “The Irish Fusiliers,” was accompanied overseas by Lieut.-Col.
Lennox, where they gave a splendid account of themselves. This battalion
had one of the finest brass and bugle bands in the Canadian forces and
also the fully equipped Brian Boru Irish War Pipe Band, the first of its
kind in Canada, made possible by the splendid generosity of Mrs. Ambrose
J. Small, of Toronto. Lieut.-Col. Lennox was married on June 5th, 1894,
to Louise, daughter of Edward Meeking, of Barrie, and has one son,
Herbert Sidney Lennox. He is a member of the following Clubs and
Societies: Albany, Military Institute; Masonic Order; Sons of England;
Orange Order; Foresters; Odd Fellows and The Workmen. In religion he is
an Anglican. Honorable Mr. Justice Lennox, of the Supreme Court of
Ontario, is a cousin of the member for North York. Lieut.-Col. Lennox
enjoys a very wide popularity among his fellow legislators, and his
constituents in North York. He makes friends everywhere and retains them
by his personal magnetism. He is recognized as one of the best types of
Canadian manhood, and has spared neither time nor energy to always
inculcate a strong National sentiment.

=Winkler, Hon. Valentine, M.P.P.=, Minister of Agriculture for Manitoba,
is a public man who has been largely identified with the progress and
growth of that province. He was born at Neustadt, Grey County, Ont., on
March 18, 1864, the son of David and Barbara J. (Lang) Winkler. He was
educated at the public schools of his native village, and as a very
young man went to Manitoba in the days of its early development,
settling at Morden, where he became a farmer, and also engaged
extensively in the lumber business. His friends and neighbours induced
him to enter politics at an early age, and he entered the municipal
office, serving as reeve of Stanley. In 1892, the late Hon. Thomas
Greenway, for some years Premier of Manitoba, induced him to run for the
riding of Rhineland, now called Morden and Rhineland, as a Liberal, and
he was elected. He was re-elected at the general elections of 1896 and
also at those of 1899, though the latter contest resulted in the defeat
of his party in many constituencies. In 1900, he was induced by Sir
Clifford Sifton, then the Western leader in the Laurier administration,
to resign his seat in the Legislature, and contest the riding of Lisgar
for the House of Commons at the Federal elections of that year. In this
contest he was unsuccessful, but was immediately re-nominated for the
Legislature in his old constituency of Rhineland, and was returned at a
by-election on November 19, 1900, and has ever since continued to hold
that seat, despite the fact that from 1899 until 1915 his party
continued in opposition. The general elections of the latter year
brought the Liberals back to power, and one of the first acts of the new
Premier, Hon. Mr. Norris, was to send for Mr. Winkler and offer him the
portfolio of Agriculture in his government. Mr. Winkler accepted, and as
an administrator has shown himself thoroughly in touch with all
progressive movements for the benefit of the farming industry. He is
widely popular with both parties in the Legislature, of which he is the
oldest member in point of service. On March 31, 1886, he married
Josephine, daughter of M. B. Rombough, Dominion Land Surveyor, and has
four children, Howard W., Hazel F., Ruth W., and Josephine R. Winkler.
His address is the Parliament Buildings, Winnipeg, Manitoba.

talented, aggressive, ambitious and persistent, he has year after year
kept himself in the public eye, and has been, and deservedly so,
accorded public recognition. On several occasions he was selected by the
Conservatives of Ottawa as their candidate for political honors in the
Federal Parliament, and on each occasion he made a gallant fight to
achieve success. When, in the early part of 1918, the famous Blue Devils
of France, those brave fellows who made themselves famous in many
battles during the terrible world war by their dare-devil conduct,
reached Ottawa, Controller Champagne was selected to receive and welcome
them. His address of welcome was one of the finest gems of oratory heard
during the war. Mr. Champagne is the son of Seraphin Champagne, grocer,
and Melina Duchene. His brother, Albert Champagne, is the member for
North Battleford, Saskatchewan, in the House of Commons. He was born in
Ottawa, May 4, 1861, and was educated in the Christian Brothers School.
He has been a frequent contributor to both English and French newspapers
and French magazines. In civic life, Controller Champagne has had a
phenomenal career. He has served in the City Council as alderman for the
years 1892-3-4-5-6-9, 1900-1-2-3-4-5-6-7, fourteen years, and as
Controller for the years 1908-9-10-11-14-15-16-17-18-19, ten years.
During the latter part of 1908, Controller Champagne, owing to the
resignation of Mayor Scott to accept a position on the Dominion Railway
Commission, became acting mayor, and held the office with much dignity.
Since Controller Champagne first entered into civic life as one of the
city’s representatives, he has rendered effective service on the
following committees: Fire and Light, Waterworks, Board of Health,
By-Laws, Printing, Library, and Finance, of which he was chairman for
several years. He was also a member of the following special committees:
Conduit, City Charter, Street Lighting, and Water Power. Controller
Champagne is a member of the Union St. Joseph Society and the Artisans
Canadiens Français. Mr. Champagne is a brilliant and successful lawyer,
and has distinguished himself in several important law cases,
particularly in two murder cases, in which his handling of the witnesses
and his ability in cross-examination created quite a stir, and placed
him in the front ranks of the legal profession in Ottawa. He practises
law in both provinces—Ontario and Quebec—and has a large clientele in
each. In 1911, Mr. Champagne was elected to the Ontario Legislature. He
was slated for, and had he not been defeated at the election of 1914,
would have become a member of the Provincial Government. He never
married. In religion he is a Roman Catholic, and in politics a
Conservative. His law office is at 30 Rideau Street, and he resides at
184 Osgoode Street, Ottawa, Ont.

=Sifton, Hon. Arthur Lewis, M.A., LL.B., D.C.L., K.C.=, was born in St.
John’s County, Middlesex, Ontario (about six miles from London,
Ontario), October 26, 1858, of Irish descent. He is the son of the late
Hon. John W. Sifton, formerly Speaker of the Manitoba Assembly, who, in
1875, with his family left Ontario for Manitoba, where he executed a
number of public contracts and conducted an extensive wheat farm near
Brandon, and Kate Sifton, and a brother of Hon. Sir Clifford Sifton,
ex-Minister of Interior and Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs in
the Laurier Cabinet. Mr. Sifton was educated in various public schools,
in Wesley College, Winnipeg, Manitoba, and in Victoria University,
Cobourg, Ontario. In 1880 he was awarded his B.A., and in 1888 his M.A.
and LL.B. degrees. In 1880, Mr. Sifton began the study of law in
Winnipeg, and was admitted to the bar of Manitoba in 1883. In 1882 he
was elected a member of the first municipal council, and, the following
year, in 1883, commenced his legal practice in Brandon, Manitoba. He
remained in Brandon until 1885 when he removed to Prince Albert,
Saskatchewan, where for a few years he continued his practice, and then
removed to Calgary, Alberta, in 1889. In 1898, Mr. Sifton was elected to
the North-West Assembly. In 1901 he was created a K.C. In the same year,
having been re-elected a member of the North-West Assembly, Mr. Sifton
became Treasurer and Commissioner of Public Works in the Haultain
Administration. In January, 1903, he resigned his portfolio to accept
the position of Chief Justice of the Superior Court of the North-West
Territories. In 1905, when the new provinces—Saskatchewan and
Alberta—were established, Mr. Sifton was appointed Chief Justice of the
Superior Court of the Province of Alberta. May 26, 1910, when the
Rutherford government resigned, Mr. Sifton also resigned his position as
Chief Justice to accept the call of the Lieutenant-Governor of the
Province to form a new Provincial Government, and was sworn in as Prime
Minister. He also assumed the portfolios of President of the Executive
Council, Provincial Treasurer, and Minister of Public Works. In 1911,
Mr. Sifton attended the coronation of their Majesties King George and
Queen Mary, and, in June of that year, was presented to King George at
St. James’ Palace. December, 1911, in addition to the other Cabinet
portfolios which he held, Mr. Sifton was appointed Minister of Railways
and Telephones. February 29, 1912, he was appointed a member of the
Commission of Conservation as one of the representatives from the
Province of Alberta. At the Provincial election in 1913, he was
re-elected to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta for Vermilion. In
1917, when, owing to the serious circumstances that had arisen in Canada
and throughout the world resulting from the effects and requirements of
the terrible world war that was then raging it was found necessary to
cut out political party differences, and to have, politically and
otherwise, a united Canada in the conduct of Dominion political,
commercial, financial, and all public and private affairs, Mr. Sifton
consented to join Sir Robert Borden, the Prime Minister, in the
formation of a Union Government, and resigning his office as Prime
Minister of the Province of Alberta, was sworn in as Minister of Customs
in the Dominion Cabinet, which position he still holds. In 1918, Mr.
Sifton accompanied Sir Robert Borden to the Peace Conference at Paris
and Versailles, as one of the Canadian delegates to that memorable
assembly in whose hands was placed arrangements and terms for the
present and future peace of the world; and it is noteworthy to state
that while there he rendered distinguished services by his advice and
otherwise in the preparation and final agreement of terms that were
placed before the Teutonic nations to accept and sign. On Sept. 20,
1882, Mr. Sifton married Mary H. Deering, daughter of William Deering,
of Cobourg, Ontario. He has two children—one girl and one boy—Nellie
Louise and Lewis Raymond. He is a member of the following clubs:
Ranchmen’s, Calgary; Edmonton, Edmonton; and the Rideau and County,
Ottawa. In politics, Mr. Sifton was formerly a Liberal, but is now a
Unionist, and in religion a Methodist. His office is in Connaught Block,
Sussex Street, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.

=Proudfoot, William, K.C., M.P.P.=, for Centre Huron and Leader of the
Opposition in the Ontario Legislature, is a barrister practising both at
Toronto and at Goderich, Ont. He was born in Colborne Township, Huron
County, on February 1st, 1859, the son of Robert and Margaret
(Darlington) Proudfoot. His mother came from Wicklow, Ireland, and his
father, a native of Perthshire, Scotland, was one of the family which
won considerable distinction in Ontario. One of his brothers was
Vice-Chancellor of Ontario, and another was Rev. Dr. Proudfoot, a leader
of religious thought. The subject of this sketch was educated in the
Public and High Schools of Goderich, Ont.; and qualified for the law as
a student in the office of James (afterward Mr. Justice) Garrow, K.C.,
and at Osgoode Hall. On being called to the bar in 1880 he commenced the
practice of law at Goderich, Ont., as a member of the firm of Garrow &
Proudfoot and he is now head of the firm of Proudfoot, Killora & Cooke
in that town. He is also a member of the firm of Proudfoot, Duncan,
Grant & Gilday, barristers and solicitors, Confederation Life Building,
Toronto, which he joined in 1902. He was created a King’s Counsel in
1902 and has long been Treasurer and Secretary of the Huron Law
Association, and is a Bencher of the Ontario Law Society. His business
interests include Directorship in the Goderich Elevator and Transit
Company, Ltd. and the Dominion Road Machinery Co’y. Ltd. Despite a large
practice throughout Huron county Mr. Proudfoot found time to take an
active part in politics and was for many years President of the West
Huron Liberal Association. In his younger days his partner, the late Mr.
Justice Garrow, was long an honored member of the Ontario Legislature,
and on the elevation of the latter to the bench, the Liberal party
naturally tendered the nomination to Mr. Proudfoot, who had already
rendered valuable municipal service as Reeve of Goderich town. He was
elected for the newly constituted riding of Centre Huron in 1908 and
re-elected at the general elections of 1911 and 1914. As a member of the
small band of Liberals sitting opposite to Sir James Whitney he soon
made his mark in debate and proved one of the most discerning and
aggressive critics of the Government, though giving his support to wise
measures. When in 1917 Hon. N. W. Rowell retired from the Leadership of
the Opposition to enter Federal politics Mr. Proudfoot was his logical
successor, a decision which was ratified by the Liberal caucus in Jan.,
1918. The war being then in progress Mr. Proudfoot took the
statesmanlike position that there should be no party contests during the
duration of the conflict and agreed to support the Government in all
reasonable measures looking exclusively to the unification of the
country for the prosecution of the war. Nevertheless a large body of
independent support rallied to his support and the signing of the
armistice found him in a stronger position both in point of followers
and as a parliamentary leader than when he accepted office. In religion
he is a member of the Church of England and was married on June 23,
1886, to Marion F. Dickson. He has two children. Isobel, now the wife of
Lieutenant E. H. Jordan, who went overseas in October, 1914, was wounded
twice and invalided home in February, 1919. Lieut. Jordan was with the
18th Field Battery, saw much service, and was decorated with the M.C.
Capt. W. Proudfoot, M.C., was a member of the 15th Battalion, was
wounded several times, and is a member of his father’s legal firm in
Toronto.

Mackenzie from 1874 to 1878, was an uncle. Hon. E. A. Smith was educated
in the High School and also at a private school in Charlottetown,
P.E.I., and originally adopted the profession of dentistry, graduating
with the degree of D.D.S. in 1887. On leaving college he went to British
Columbia, where he practised for two years, and subsequently practised
for a year in New Brunswick. He entered his father’s business in 1891,
and since 1912 has conducted it under his own name. In 1916, he was
induced to follow the family tradition and enter politics, and was
elected to the Legislature as Liberal for Westmorland County, defeating
Hon. P. J. Mahony, Minister of Public Works. At the general elections of
1917, he was again elected, and was selected as a member of the Foster
government, taking over the portfolio of Lands and Mines, for which his
business experience amply qualified him. He has since given an effective
business administration to the department which was sorely needed, and
by his policies has materially added to the public revenues. Sat in Town
Council, Shediac, for several years as Alderman, and elected Mayor for
1906 and 1907, by acclamation; President of Liberal Association for
County of Westmorland from 1894 to 1911; President of Provincial Liberal
Association several years, which position is still held. He is an
Anglican in religion, and a Past Master, A.F. & A.M. His recreations are
salmon and trout fishing and shooting of small and big game. On
September 30, 1896, he married Euphemia, daughter of Mr. Colin Russell,
of the Customs Department, Ottawa, and has four children: Gladys, born
1897; Russell, born 1899; Donald, born 1902; and John, born 1911. Though
Mr. Smith’s official duties compel his presence in Fredericton, N.B.,
for the greater part of his time, he still makes his home at Shediac.

=Turgeon, Hon. William Ferdinand Alphonse, K.C., M.P.P.=,
Attorney-General of the Province of Saskatchewan, is one of the best
known leaders of the legal profession in the Canadian West. He was born
at Bathurst, New Brunswick, on June 3, 1877, the son of Onesiphore
Turgeon, a French-Canadian journalist, and his wife Margaret Eulalia
Baldwin, a lady of English descent. Politics comes naturally to him, for
his father is a member of the House of Commons for Gloucester County,
New Brunswick, and has long been a prominent figure in the public life
of that province, while his brother, J. G. Turgeon, M.P.P., is a member
of the Alberta Legislature. The subject of this sketch was educated in
New York City, and later at Laval University, Quebec, graduating in Arts
in 1899 with the degree of B.A., and in law in 1902. Shortly afterwards
he went to the West, and was called to the bar of Saskatchewan. He also
became prominent as a leader in the Liberal party, and at a by-election
on October 12, 1907, was elected to the legislature for Prince Albert.
At the general elections of August, 1908, he contested two ridings in
behalf of his party—Prince Albert and Duck Lake. He was defeated in the
former, but elected to the latter. At the general elections of 1912, he
stood for the riding of Humboldt, and was successful, and has ever since
represented that riding. Hon. Mr. Turgeon joined the Ministry of Hon.
Walter Scott as Attorney-General on September 23, 1907, shortly before
his first political contest in Prince Albert. He has ever since
continued to hold that portfolio, and for some years filled that of
Provincial Secretary as well. His oratorical powers are exceptional, and
he speaks with equal facility both in French and English. He is a Roman
Catholic in religion; and on February 18, 1901, married Gertrude,
daughter of Gerome Boudreau, Petit Rocher, New Brunswick. He has five
children: Alice, born May 13, 1902; Cecile, February 19, 1907; Wilfrid,
August 20, 1910; Eveline, November 16, 1913; and Frances Regis, July 12,
1918. He resides at 2320 Angus Street, Regina, Sask.

=Pritchard, Henry Thomas=, who was born in London, England, February 26,
1852, came to Canada, locating in Ottawa in 1875, and started in
business as an engraver. Three years later, in 1878, he formed a
partnership with J. E. Andrews, under the firm name of Pritchard and
Andrews. Being exceptionally clever engravers, their business so
increased that in 1897 a joint stock company was formed, and is now
established and known as “The Pritchard-Andrews Company of Ottawa,
Limited,” with J. A. Seybold as President and Henry Thomas Pritchard as
Secretary-Treasurer and Manager, with their head office at 264 Sparks
Street, Ottawa. Mr. Pritchard is the son of William Pritchard, cabinet
manufacturer, of Bishopgate Street, London, England, and Elizabeth Ann
(Thompson) Pritchard, and received his education in a boarding school in
London. Having served his time to engraving in England, he crossed the
Atlantic Ocean, and, arriving in Ottawa, Ontario, has made that city his
home ever since. In 1887, Mr. Pritchard married Margaret Ramsay Black,
daughter of John Black, of Hamilton, Ontario. Four sons and four
daughters have blessed the union—Walter, Elizabeth Ann, Harold, Ernest,
John, Margaret, Emily and Edith. Mr. Pritchard is an Anglican in
religion and a Unionist in politics. He resides at Eastview.

=Dunning, Hon. Charles Avery, M.P.P.=, is Minister of Agriculture and
Provincial Treasurer for the Province of Saskatchewan, and one of the
youngest and ablest of the public men of the West. He was born at Croft,
Leicestershire, England, on July 31, 1885, the son of Samuel and
Katherine (Hall) Dunning. His father was a farmer, and he was educated
in the public schools of the Motherland. In 1903, as a boy of seventeen,
he settled in Saskatchewan, and engaged in farming at Beaverdale in that
province, an industry which he has ever since conducted on a large
scale. He is one of the most prominent of those who organized the
movement in the West for the betterment of agricultural conditions, and,
in 1910, became a Director of the Saskatchewan Grain Growers’
Association. He was also its Vice-President from 1911 to 1914. In 1911,
he organized the Saskatchewan Co-operative Elevator Company, and acted
as general manager of this remarkably successful enterprise from its
foundation until 1916. From 1911 to 1916, he was a member of the
Executive Board of the Canadian Council of Agriculture, and, in 1918,
served on the Canada Food Board organized in connection with the war as
Director of Food Production. Earlier, in 1913, he was a member of the
Royal Commission appointed by the Government of Saskatchewan to
investigate the question of agricultural credits, and also that of grain
markets in Europe. He has also been a frequent contributor to the press
on such subjects, his vast fund of expert knowledge making him an
especially welcome contributor. In 1916, he resigned his position as
general manager of the Saskatchewan Co-operative Elevators to enter the
Legislature of that Province. He was elected for the riding of Kinistino
by acclamation. At the general elections of 1917, he was returned for
Moose Jaw County. After his first election he was appointed Provincial
Treasurer in the Martin administration, having been sworn in on October
20, 1916. Exactly one year later, he was also appointed Minister of
Railways, and in addition on May 16, 1918, he became Minister of
Telephones. On the rearrangement of portfolios, February 15, 1919, he
retained his old portfolio of Provincial Treasurer, and became Minister
of Agriculture as well, a step that was applauded by the whole farming
community. He is a Liberal in politics and a Presbyterian in religion,
and a member of the Assiniboia Club, Regina, and the Wascana Country
Club. His favorite recreation is golf. On July 3, 1913, he married Ada,
daughter of John Rowlatt (deceased) of Nassington, Northants, England,
and has one son and one daughter. His home is at 2150 Retallack Street,
Regina, Sask.

=Williams, the Right Rev. Lennox Waldron, Lord Bishop of Quebec, M.A.
(Oxon.), D.D.=, is the only son of the late Right Rev. J. W. Williams,
D.D., fourth Bishop of the same diocese. He was born at Lennoxville,
while his father was headmaster of Bishop’s College School, on November
12, 1859. His mother’s maiden name was Miss Anna Maria Waldron. He
received his earlier education at Bishop’s College School, from which
institution he went to St. John’s College, Oxford, where he received his
degree of B.A. in 1882, and his M.A. in 1887. In 1899 he received the
degree of D.D. from Bishop’s College University. His first charge as a
clergyman was that of curate in St. Matthew’s Church, of Quebec, while
the Rev. Charles Hamilton (afterwards Bishop of Ottawa and
Archbishop)—was its rector. A vacancy occurring in the rectorship of
that charge, the Rev. Lennox Williams was selected to fill it. In 1899
he was promoted to be Dean of the Cathedral and Rector of Quebec. In
1890 he was unanimously elected Coadjutor Bishop of Ontario, but felt
obliged to decline. On the death of Bishop Dunn, he was elected Lord
Bishop of the Diocese of Quebec. As a native of the Province of Quebec,
he has been identified with the religious life of Quebec and the Eastern
Townships during his lifetime. During his ministry he has always taken
an active interest in the schools and colleges of the diocese, having
been for years a member of the corporation of Bishop’s College,
Lennoxville, Chairman of the Protestant Board of School Commissioners of
Quebec City, and a Director of the High School. While he was Dean of the
Cathedral, he was chosen a delegate to the Pan-Anglican Congress held in
London, England, in 1908; and, in 1910, he again took part in the
Anglican Church Congress held at Halifax, Nova Scotia. In 1887 he
married Miss Caroline Annie Rhodes, daughter of the late
Lieutenant-Colonel William Rhodes, at one time Minister of Agriculture
for the Province of Quebec. The Bishop and Mrs. Williams had four
children, viz., James William, who, after taking his degree at Oxford,
joined the Canadian Army in the great war, and was killed in action at
the battle of the Somme; Violet Mary; Gertrude, wife of Colonel R. O.
Alexander, D.S.O.; Sydney Waldron, gentleman cadet at R.M.C., Kingston.

was defeated. First elected to the Provincial Legislature at the general
election June 14th, 1911, and re-elected in 1916 with a largely
increased majority. He resigned his seat in November, 1917, to contest
his constituency as a Unionist candidate for the Federal House, but was
defeated after one of the most bitter contests in the Province of Nova
Scotia. Col. Margeson polled the largest vote he ever received. His
opponent was a strong anti-conscriptionist. He has been prominently
identified with the Canadian Militia, being Lieutenant of the 75th
Regiment, 1910, Captain in the 25th Nova Scotia Overseas Battalion,
December 1914, with which unit he went to France. Promoted to the rank

=Thornton, Hon. Robert Stirton, M.P., M.B., C.M., LL.D.=, Minister of
Education for the Province of Manitoba, is one of the educational
leaders of Western Canada, though not a native of this country. He was
born at Edinburgh, Scotland, on May 8, 1863, the son of David and Mary
(Gavin) Thornton. His parents decided that he should adopt the career of
a physician, and after a good general education in his native city at
Heriot’s Hospital school, he entered Edinburgh University, and graduated
in 1884 with the degree of M.B., C.M. In the same year he came to
Canada, and commenced the practice of his profession at Deloraine,
Manitoba. He became well-known throughout the province, and, in 1896,
was elected President of the Manitoba Medical Council; and, later,
President of the Medical Council of Canada. Among other matters in which
he interested himself was that of horticulture, a neglected pursuit in
the western country, and became recognized as a pioneer horticulturist
of the prairies, and an inspiration to others to adopt such a hobby. He
became identified with the Liberal party, and, in 1907, was elected to
the Manitoba Legislature for Deloraine. Though defeated in 1910, he was
again elected in 1914, and also in the general elections of 1915, which
resulted in the overthrow of the Roblin administration. He had taken a
very strong stand against the indifference of the authorities to school
problems; and when Hon. Mr. Norris was called upon to form a government,
he entrusted to Dr. Thornton the portfolio of Education, which, under
the peculiar circumstances of the case, was perhaps the most important
within the Premier’s gift. In no section of the world is the problem of
education more difficult, owing to the great number of nationalities
represented in the numbers of unlettered immigrants that poured into
Manitoba in the years preceding the great war. With the problem of
making the children of these newcomers good Canadians, conversant with
the language and institutions of the land of their adoption, Dr.
Thornton grappled, in 1915, and three and a half years later it was the
testimony of the Winnipeg “Tribune,” that the change of government had
been worth while, if only for what had been accomplished in making the
schools of Manitoba Canadian. Before he became Minister of Education,
large numbers of the public schools were nondescript, and breeding
centres of foreign speech and ideals. In a determined and unflinching
way, Dr. Thornton put into action, through the machinery of the schools,
the ideals of true Canadianism, and for the first time enforced the law
with regard to an English education for every child of school age in
Manitoba. As a result of his policies, other western provinces have
followed his example, and many educationists of the western United
States look to Manitoba’s system of dealing with the foreign problem in
education as a model. Latterly, Dr. Thornton has taken a strong stand
against immigration of the old indiscriminate sort, and proclaims the
doctrine that anyone who comes to Canada must be prepared to shoulder
all the responsibilities, with the privileges, duties, and rights of
Canadian citizenship. By the many advocates of these new views he is
looked up to as a leader. In recognition of his services, Queen’s
University (Kingston) some time ago conferred on him the honorary degree
of LL.D. Dr. Thornton is a Presbyterian in religion, and a member of the
Masonic Order. On April 30, 1889, he married Mary, daughter of Robert
Johnston, Princeton, Ont., and has no children. He resides at Winnipeg
and at Deloraine, Manitoba.

=Bailey, Charles Frederick=, Agricultural Commissioner for the Province
of Ontario, is, singularly enough, a native of the Maritime Provinces.
He was born at Kentville, Nova Scotia, in 1880, and his mother, who
still survives, is now Mrs. P. Innes of that town. He was educated in
King’s County High School, Kentville, and had a practical insight into
agriculture as a lad on a Nova Scotia farm. In 1902 he resolved to
qualify himself on the scientific side of agriculture and entered
himself at the Ontario Agricultural College at Guelph, Ont., which holds
a standard position throughout North America. From 1904 to 1907 he was
engaged largely in commercial work related to this basic interest of the
country’s prosperity and returned to the O.A.C. in the latter year. In
1909 he received from its affiliated Institution the University of
Toronto, the degree of Bachelor of Scientific Agriculture. At that time
the Ontario Department of Agriculture was looking about for expert young
men to carry on the work of agricultural instruction and development and
on receiving the above degree Mr. Bailey was in June, 1909, appointed
Live Stock Specialist for Ontario. He brought a great deal of enthusiasm
and knowledge to bear on his task and in 1912 was promoted to the post
of Assistant Deputy Minister of Agriculture by the late Hon. James Duff.
A few years later the office of Commissioner of Agriculture was created
in order to place a permanent official of expert knowledge in charge of
policies for the betterment of agriculture in this province. Mr.
Bailey’s grasp of all the problems of his subject is exceptional and he
holds a high reputation as an expert in other states and provinces. As a
young man he was a Captain in the King’s County (N.S.) Regiment, but has
always eschewed politics. In religion he is a member of the Church of
England, and some years ago married Louise D., daughter of David Hogg,
Perth, Ont. He has had three children, of whom one, a boy born in 1915,
survives. His address is 164 Walmer Road, Toronto.

=Stapells, Richard A.=, is one of the best known figures in the business
and social life of Toronto, where he was born on February 12, 1879, the
son of Richard George and Susan (Carruthers) Stapells. He was educated
in the Toronto Public Schools and commenced his business career with the
firm of Caldecott, Burton & Spence, from which so many successful
Canadian business men have graduated. About 1900 he left the employ of
that firm to pay a visit to England and engaged in the commission
business in London for some two years. On his return to Toronto in 1902
he purchased and incorporated the business now known as the McElroy
Manufacturing Company, Limited, makers of “Royal Garments,” with offices
at 47 Simcoe Street, Toronto, of which he is President and Managing
Director. Despite the fact that he is a most successful business man who
had won success at an age when many men are but on the lower rungs of
the ladder, Mr. Stapells’ general interests are remarkably wide and his
artistic tastes exceptional. His chief hobby is music, for which he has
a great natural talent. As a boy he was an accomplished violinist and a
member of the Toronto Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by the late Dr.
F. H. Torrington. At the age of fifteen he was a member of the violin
section of the great orchestra formed for the Festival in connection
with the opening of Massey Hall in 1894. Later he obtained vocal
instruction with the best masters in London, England, and New York, and
for several years has been baritone soloist of the Church of the Messiah
(Anglican), of which he is a member, and a lay delegate to the Anglican
Synod, representing Church of Messiah. He was for some years also a very
enthusiastic member of the executive of the National Chorus, a
celebrated Toronto choral organization. In social and patriotic work he
is equally active. He has long been a prominent member of the Empire
Club of Canada, Toronto; was one of its vice-presidents in 1913-14 and
President 1918-19. In the latter capacity he has induced many eminent
men to come to Toronto and address the public on questions of the day,
and made the Club one of the most vital organs of opinion in the
Dominion. He is a life member of York Pioneer and Historical Society;
life member of St. George’s Society; life member of the Canadian Red
Cross Society, member of the Executive Committee, Canadian Defence
League; member of the Executive, Overseas Club, and member of the Navy
League of Canada, in connection with all of which he was active in
promoting patriotic movements during the war and the succeeding
repatriation period. Is a Trustee of Queen’s University. He is also a
member of the Toronto Board of Trade, member of the Canadian
Manufacturers Association (an Executive officer thereof in 1914), member
of the Royal Colonial Institute and the Canadian Institute; a past
president of the Dufferin School Old Boys’ Association; and belongs to

=Brodeur, Hon. Louis Philippe=, is one of the Judges of the Supreme
Court of Canada, Ottawa, to which position he was appointed August 11,
1911. Mr. Brodeur was born at Beloeil, Quebec, August 21, 1862. He is
the son of Toussaint Brodeur, a patriot of 1837, and of Justine Lambert.
He was educated in the College of St. Hyacinthe, was graduated LL.B. at
Laval University, and, in 1904, received the degree of LL.D. from that
university. Called to the bar in 1884, he was in 1899 created a K.C. He
has written largely for the press, and, in 1896, was editor of “Le
Soir.” In 1891, Mr. Brodeur was elected to the House of Commons for
Rouville, Quebec. He was re-elected in 1896, and became Deputy-Speaker
of the House, and on his re-election in 1900 was appointed Speaker. He
was re-elected at the next two general elections, viz., in the elections
of 1904 and 1908. Mr. Brodeur gained much prominence owing to his keen
knowledge of parliamentary procedure, and while Speaker was noted for
the able and dignified manner in which he gave his decisions on all
questions that came before him for solution. Before entering Parliament,
Mr. Brodeur had gained an enviable reputation in the legal profession,
and, as a member of the House of Commons—he being a fluent and eloquent
speaker in both English and French, and one who had studiously labored
to acquire a masterly knowledge of parliamentary procedure—he soon rose
in the estimation and confidence of his fellow members; and his
affability in politics, as in social life, made him a great favorite. In
1904, Mr. Brodeur was called to the Laurier Cabinet, and was sworn in as
Minister of Inland Revenue. In 1906, on the death of Hon. Raymond
Prefontaine, Mr. Brodeur was transferred to the Department of Marine and
Fisheries, and when the Department of Naval Service was organized he was
appointed head of it. It was Mr. Brodeur who was the author of the first
Naval Bill introduced in the Canadian Parliament in 1910, calling for
the organization of the Navy. It was Mr. Brodeur who introduced in
Parliament a Bill against the American Tobacco Trust, which proved
successful in checking the methods the Tobacco Company wanted to employ
in Canada. The success resulting from the passing of this legislation
attracted the attention of the people of Canada, and even the United
States press commented favorably upon it. Taking a keen interest in
navigation in all Canadian waters, Mr. Brodeur was instrumental in
having established along the St. Lawrence River innumerable aids to
navigation which have made that river, night or day, or in fog,
navigable. In 1907 and 1911, Mr. Brodeur was a member of the Imperial
Conference at London, and, by Imperial Order-in-Council of August 8,
1907, Mr. Brodeur was appointed by the King one of the
joint-plenipotentiaries to negotiate the first treaty which has been
exclusively negotiated by Canadians or representatives of any other
sister nations of the Empire, viz., the Franco-Canadian Treaty. In 1909,
Mr. Brodeur represented Canada at the Imperial Defence Conference, and
was Canada’s representative to the Washington Conference held in
pursuance of the decision of the Hague Tribunal on the North Atlantic
fisheries. Mr. Brodeur was created an officier of the Legion d’Honneur
in 1908. He is one of the Governors of the Notre Dame Hospital. In 1887,
Mr. Brodeur married Emma Brillon, daughter of J. R. Brillon, notary, of
Beloeil. He has four sons and one daughter. One of his sons was during
the war a Lieutenant in the Imperial Navy. Mr. Brodeur is a member of
the following clubs: Hunt, Rideau, Rivermead, of Ottawa, Montreal
(Montreal), Winchester (Montreal), and Country Club of Montreal. He
resides at 229 Chapel St., Ottawa.

Quebec, having been married there in 1635, to Anne, daughter of Abraham
Martin, the owner of a piece of ground in Quebec known as the plains of
Abraham. Entering the Department of the Interior in the Canadian Civil
Service in 1879, which Department was then presided over by the late Rt.
Hon. Sir John A. Macdonald, K.C.B., Prime Minister and Minister of
Interior, Mr. Côté soon made himself an attentive, valuable and trusted
employee. He rapidly rose from one station to another until 1904 when he
became chief clerk, in 1906 registrar of Dominion Land Patents and chief
of the Lands Patents Branch, and in 1913 controller. Mr. Côté was a

1900 of the Royal Commission on claims of the half-breeds of the
Provisional District of Saskatchewan, and of persons who had served as
scouts, or otherwise, during the Rebellion of 1885. Mr. Côté is the
author of many valuable publications, some, if not all, of which will
remain for all time to come as useful reference for historical,
parliamentary, and other purposes, and which, as the years pass, will
increase in value and become indispensable. The following are to be
found among his literary works already published: “Political
Appointments, Parliaments, and the Judicial Bench in the Dominion of
Canada 1867 to 1895,” published in 1896; Supplement thereto up to 1903,
published in 1903; Volume II. to the original work, for period 1896 to
1917, published in 1917; “Appendix 1865 to 1867 and Index,” published in
1918, to his father’s work published in 1866, entitled “Political
Appointments and Elections in the Province of Canada from 1841 to 1865.”
The whole series providing an indispensable record for present and
future reference of public men and public events in Canada during the
last seventy-six years, 1841 to 1917. Mr. Narcisse Omer Côté, I.S.O.,
was born in Quebec, September 14, 1859. He is the son of the late Joseph
Olivier Côté, a notary public for the Province of Quebec, and clerk of
H.M.’s Privy Council for Canada, and Marie Julie Léocadie Leprobon. He
was educated at de la Salle Commercial Academy, Ottawa, and the
University of Ottawa. On the occasion of the coronation of His Majesty
King George the Fifth, in 1911, Mr. Côté was created a Companion of the
Imperial Service Order. In 1907, Mr. Côté married Mabel Edna, daughter
of the late Hon. Désiré Girouard, D.C.L., Puisne Judge of the Supreme
Court of Canada. For several years, Mr. Côté was connected with the
Canadian militia; and was formerly captain in the Governor-General’s
Foot Guards. Mr. Côté is a member of the Rideau Club and the Royal
Ottawa Golf Club. He is a Roman Catholic in religion and resides at 54

Collegiate Institute, and the University of Toronto. From the latter
institution he graduated in June, 1893, with the degree of B.A., and

on the staff of the Toronto “World” under W. F. Maclean, M.P. A year
later he was invited to join the staff of the Toronto “Star,” then in
the early stages of its career, and shortly afterward became its
representative in the press gallery of the Ontario Legislature. Mr.
Davidson showed a grasp of public issues beyond the ordinary, and during
the seven years he remained with the “Star” made its legislative reports
a definite feature of the newspaper. In 1901 the Canadian West was just
on the verge of the tremendous development which has marked the first
two decades of this century, and Mr. Davidson resolved to try his
fortunes there. In 1902 he established himself at Calgary, then a town
of about 3,000 inhabitants, and founded the “Morning Albertan.” From
comparatively humble beginnings it has developed into one of the most
widely known newspapers in Canada. Throughout its career Mr. Davidson
has retained the position of editor-in-chief and proprietor. He soon
became prominently identified with the Liberal party in the province,
and at the Alberta general elections of 1917 was elected to the
Legislature for the riding of North Calgary. Few members of that body
have as deep a knowledge of public questions and of parliamentary
procedure. Mr. Davidson has travelled extensively, and one of his
favorite pastimes is mountain-climbing. He is a member of St. Andrews
Golf Club, of the A.F. & A.M., and the I.O.F. He is a Senator of the
University of Alberta, and a Presbyterian in religion. He has been twice
married: first, on June 6, 1899, to Christiana Constance Robertson,
daughter of Rev. James Robertson, D.D., of Toronto, Superintendent of
Missions for the Presbyterian Church of Canada. She died in March, 1904,
and on September 10, 1913, Mr. Davidson married Ethel M. Heydon,
daughter of George Heydon, of Yarmouth Centre, Ontario. He has three
children, James R., William M., and Marian C. R. Davidson.

=Parent, Hon. Simon Napoleon, K.C.=, who was Chairman of the National
Transcontinental Railway Commission from 1905 to 1911, is the son of
Simon Polycarpe and Luce (Belanger) Parent, of Beauport, Quebec, and was
born there September 12, 1855. His education was had at the Quebec
Normal School and Laval University, and between 1881 and 1902 he was
awarded the following degrees and honours: Laval University, LL.L., with
Lorne Gold Medal and Tessier Prize, 1881; LL.D., 1902; D.C.L. (Hon.),
Bishop’s College University, Lennoxville, 1902. In 1881 Mr. Parent was
called to the Bar, and was created K.C. in 1899. In October, 1877, he
married Marie Louise Clara, daughter of the late Ambroise Gendron. Four
sons and four daughters have blessed the union. At present Mr. Parent is
President of the Quebec Streams Commission for the Province of Quebec.
When admitted to the Bar, Mr. Parent successfully practised his
profession in the city of Quebec, and from the start was looked upon as
a practical man and a good and reliable lawyer. He served as an alderman
in the Quebec City Council from 1890 to 1904, and was Mayor of the city
from 1894 to 1905, during which time he built the new City Hall. Largely
through his perseverance and energetic work, the splendid Quebec Bridge
was built, and it was he who originated the park at St. Roch, between
St. Roch and St. Sauveur. Quebec city streets were improved and the
finances of the city placed on a better footing. Mr. Parent sat in the
local legislature for St. Sauveur in the Liberal interest from 1890 to
1905, and served in the Marchand administration as Commissioner of Crown
Lands, Mines and Forests from 1897 to 1900. On Mr. Marchand’s death in
the latter year, Mr. Parent was called upon to succeed him as Prime
Minister of the Province, and held that position up to 1905, when he
resigned at the request of the Right Hon. Sir Wilfrid Laurier to accept
the position of Chairman of the National Transcontinental Railway
Commission, with headquarters at Ottawa, which Commission had charge and
control of the construction of the Eastern Division of the
Transcontinental Railway, extending from the city of Moncton, N.B., in
the east to the city of Winnipeg, Manitoba, in the west, and the
operation thereof until completed and leased to the Grand Trunk Pacific
Railway Company. Mr. Parent was President of the Quebec Bridge Company
from 1897 to 1908, was formerly a director of the Quebec Railway, Light
and Power Company and the Quebec and Lake St. John Railway. During his
whole public career, Mr. Parent has held the reputation for being an
honest and able man; as one of the most industrious administrators of
modern times; as a man of decision, business and legal ability, and rare
enterprise in public matters; unassuming, courteous, and practical. A
Roman Catholic in religion, Mr. Parent has ever been a staunch Liberal,
and one of the late Sir Wilfrid Laurier’s best and most influential
supporters. He is a member of the Rideau, Laurentian, and Ottawa Hunt
Clubs in Ottawa, and of the Garrison Club, Quebec. His Ottawa residence
is at 485 King Edward Avenue.

=Rutherford, John Gunion, C.M.G., V.S.=, Ottawa, Honorary Associate of
the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, Commissioner, Board of Railway
Commissioners for Canada (Ottawa, Ont.) born at Mountain Cross,
Peeblesshire, Scotland, on December 25, 1857, son of Rev. Robert
Rutherford, M.A., and his wife Agnes Gunion. In 1887, he married Edith,
daughter of Washington Boultbee, of Ancaster, Ont., by whom he has three
daughters. He was educated at the High School of Glasgow, and later
spent several years in the practical study of agriculture in the
counties of East Lothian and Selkirk. Coming to Canada at the age of
seventeen, he attended the Ontario Agricultural College in 1875 and
1876, being one of the earliest students at that institution, and later
gained valuable practical experience in agriculture on the famous Bow
Park Farm at Brantford, Ontario. In 1879 he graduated from the Ontario
Veterinary College with honors, winning the gold medal for the best
general examination, and numerous other prizes. He practised veterinary
medicine for several years in Ontario, the United States and Mexico, and
returning to Canada in 1884, settled at Portage la Prairie, Manitoba,
where he engaged in general practice and horse breeding operations. He
served as Veterinary Officer with the North-West Field Force under
General Middleton during the Riel rebellion in 1885, and holds medal and
clasp for that campaign. During his residence in Portage la Prairie he
was for several years President of the Horse Breeders’ Association of
Manitoba and the North-West Territories; President of the Manitoba
Veterinary Association; President of the Manitoba and Lakeside
Agricultural Society; the Island Park Racing Association, and the St.
Andrew’s Society of Portage la Prairie. In 1884 he was appointed
Veterinary Inspector for the Manitoba Government, an appointment which
he held until 1892, when he was elected to represent the constituency of
Lakeside (Portage Plains) in the Manitoba Legislature, in which body he
was Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture. He was re-elected by
acclamation in 1896, but after one session resigned to enter Dominion
politics as representative for the constituency of Macdonald, which then
comprised over one-sixth of the province of Manitoba. He sat as member
for this constituency in the Dominion House until 1900, and in 1901 went
to Great Britain as special Quarantine Officer for the Canadian
Department of Agriculture. In 1902, he was appointed Chief Veterinary
Inspector, and in 1904, after organizing the Health of Animals Branch,
he became Veterinary Director-General. In 1906, he also took over the
office of Live Stock Commissioner, and in the same and the succeeding
year organized the present Meat and Canned Foods Inspection Service.
During his tenure of office many original and radical departures were
made in connection with the control and eradication of contagious
diseases among the live stock of the Dominion, the results achieved
being eminently satisfactory. Under his direction, the work of the Live
Stock Branch was very considerably extended, and brought into close
correlation with that of the Health of Animals Branch, joint supervision
over the work of both branches being in a number of cases exercised by
the same officers, especially in those provinces farthest from Ottawa.
In 1908, he went twice to Rome as delegate for Canada to the
International Institute of Agriculture, and in the same year was
appointed to represent the Dominion at the International Congress on
Tuberculosis at Washington, D.C. He was President of the American
Veterinary Medical Association in 1908-09, and Chairman since its
inception of the International Commission on the Control of Bovine
Tuberculosis. He was for several years President of the St. Andrews
Society of Ottawa, and from 1909 to 1911 President of the Civil Service
Association of Canada. He was created a C.M.G. in 1910. In May, 1911, he
resigned from the Dominion service, but at the request of the Government
retained office until March, 1912. Immediately thereafter, he was
engaged by Lord Shaughnessy, then President of the Canadian Pacific
Railway Company, to undertake a campaign for the general development of
the live stock industry and the encouragement of mixed farming in the
three prairie provinces. In the organization of the campaign he found it
advisable to co-ordinate this special work with that of the Company’s
Department of Natural Resources at Calgary, Alberta, and in the
following spring (1913) he was appointed Superintendent of Agriculture
and Animal Industry, a position involving full responsibility for all
the agricultural operations of the Company, including the educational
and experimental activities in connection with its irrigation projects
in Alberta. From 1913 to 1919, he was President of the Western Canada
Live Stock Union, an organization in the creation of which he was
largely instrumental, and which comprises in its membership all live
stock associations and other bodies interested in the production of live
stock in the four Western Provinces. In December, 1918, his portrait in
oils was added by the live stock men of Canada to the collection of
similar pictures of live stock celebrities in the Saddle and Sirloin
Club of Chicago. He was a member of the Dominion Economic and
Development Commission, as also a member of the Saskatchewan Royal Live
Stock Commission, and has since its inception been Chairman of the Joint
Committee on Commerce and Agriculture. While resident in Alberta he was
Vice-Chairman of the Provincial Board of Agricultural Education, as also
President of the Alberta Thoroughbred Horse Breeders’ Association,
besides holding office in numerous other live stock and kindred
organizations. He has had exceptional opportunities of acquiring a
practical knowledge of Canadian agriculture, having actually farmed,
more or less extensively, in every province of the Dominion except
Prince Edward Island, his own farm being situated in the Chilliwack
Valley in British Columbia. He was appointed to the Board of Railway
Commissioners for Canada in November, 1918, and assumed office in
February, 1919. Dr. Rutherford is a member of the following clubs:
Ranchmen’s (Calgary), Rideau (Ottawa), University Club (Ottawa), Royal
Ottawa Golf Club (Ottawa), and his home address is 218 MacLaren Street,
Ottawa, Ont.

=Breithaupt, John C.=, of Kitchener, Ont., is one of the most widely
known business men of Canada, and has been particularly identified with
the leather industry. He was born at Buffalo, N.Y., on February 27,
1859, the son of the late Louis and Catherine (Hailer) Breithaupt; but
his parents removed to Kitchener, then known as Berlin, Ont., when he
was very young. He was educated in the public and high schools of that
thriving manufacturing city and later at the North-Western College,
Naperville, Ill., of which despite his Canadian citizenship, he has in
later life been a Trustee for upwards of twenty years. In Berlin, Ont.,
he became associated in the tanning business of his father, which of
late years has grown to great dimensions. He is Secretary of the
Breithaupt Leather Company, Ltd., with tanneries at Kitchener,
Penetanguishene and Woodstock, Ont., and President of the Hastings
Tannery Company, Ltd., with head office at Kitchener and tannery at
Hastings, Ont. In addition to his widespread commercial interests Mr.
Breithaupt has shown unselfish activity in public affairs. While his
city was still known as Berlin he was a member of the Municipal Council
for six years, first as Councillor, then as Reeve, and later, in 1896-7,
as Mayor. He has been a member of the Board of Water Commissioners of
the city since 1899 continuously, and Chairman for every year of that
period but one. He held the office of President of the Local Board of
Trade for a term, and is also a member of the Toronto Board of Trade,
with which he has been connected since 1891. In all municipal movements
for the betterment of civic government he has been a leader, and his
voice has frequently been heard in the cause of progress in the province
at large. He was President of the Berlin and Waterloo Hospital for
several years and takes a deep interest in religious matters. He is a
member of the Evangelical Association, and has been a member of various
Boards and Commissions of the Church, having been delegate to the
General Conference in 1911 and again elected in 1919 in a similar
capacity. He is a member of the following clubs: Lancaster, Grand River
County and Golf, and Ontario Club (Toronto). In 1892 he married Caroline
C., eldest daughter of the late J. S. Anthes, furniture manufacturer of
Kitchener, and has six children: John Edward, chemical engineer of the
various Breithaupt tanneries; Louise Catherine, Carl Louis, who early in
1919 returned from overseas after two years’ service with the Canadian
Engineers in France; Freida Caroline, Walter Hailer, and Helena Esther
Breithaupt.

=Cronyn, Hume, M.P.=, who represents the city of London, Ont., in the
House of Commons, was born in London on August 28th, 1864, the son of
Verschoyle Cronyn, LL.B., K.C., and Sophy Cronyn. The latter was a
daughter of the late Hon. William Hume Blake, and a sister of the late
Hon. Edward Blake, formerly leader of the Liberal party in the Canadian
House of Commons, and later one of the ornaments of the British House of
Commons as member for Longford, Ireland. The subject of this sketch was
educated at Dr. Tassie’s famous grammar school, Galt, Ont., and at
Toronto University, from which he graduated with the degree of B.A. He
qualified for the law, and in 1889 received the degree of LL.B. from the
same institution, and in that year was called to the Bar. He at once
commenced the practice of law at London, and continued therein for the
next eighteen years. In 1907 he gave up practice to take up the post of
General Manager of The Huron and Erie Mortgage Corporation, a position
he still holds in combination with the office of Vice-President. He is
also General Manager of the Canada Trust Company, London, and a Director
of the Mutual Life Assurance Company of Canada. Though long identified
with the Liberal party, both from conviction and family association, Mr.
Cronyn always declined public honors until the political crisis
attendant on the adoption of the policy of conscription by Sir Robert
Borden arose in 1917. Mr. Cronyn was one of many Ontario Liberals who
decided to support the Prime Minister in forming a Union Government to
carry out that policy, and when the general elections were announced on
this issue, accepted the nomination as a Unionist candidate for the
riding of London. The Laurier Liberals decided to make London one of the
chief arenas of their battle against conscription, by nominating Mr.
George S. Gibbons who had also been prominent in the politics of that
city. After one of the most hotly contested campaigns of that momentous
election, Mr. Cronyn was elected by a majority of over 4,000. In his
younger days, he had been prominent in military circles; while a student
at Toronto University he had enlisted in the Queen’s Own Rifles and
served with that famous regiment in the North-West Rebellion of 1885,
taking part in the engagement of Cut Knife Creek, for which he holds the
medal and clasp. On returning to London, he joined the 7th Fusiliers,
and served as Major in that battalion from 1899 to 1907, when he
retired. During the late war he was active in promoting all patriotic
causes. He is a member of the following clubs: London; London Hunt and
Country; Toronto; Rideau (Ottawa); Royal Societies and the Zeta Psi
fraternity. In religion he is an Anglican, and on September 6, 1892,
married Frances A., second daughter of John Labatt, of London. He has
three sons and two daughters, and his residence is at 580 Dundas Street,
London, Ont.

Company, later as manager of the Chaudiere Lumber Company, and for seven
years as manager of the McAuliffe-Davis Lumber Company, Limited, of
which he is now President. Mr. Davis is not only recognized as one of
the leading retail lumbermen of eastern Ontario, and one with entire
knowledge of trade conditions in Ottawa and throughout the valley, but
is known to be one of the leaders among the younger business element in
the city. In the Company, Mr. Davis has associated with him Mr. W. Allen

Export Lumber Company; Mr. W. J. Armstrong, Secretary-Treasurer; and the
following constitute the Board of Directors: Messrs. Albert Mayno Davis,
W. H. McAuliffe, George I. Dewar, W. A. Taft, and W. Allen Taft. Mr.
Albert Mayno Davis is the son of C. W. Davis, Burlington, Vermont, and
Jennie Taft, of the same place, and was born at Burlington, October 3,
1878. He was educated at the Burlington High School and the University
of Vermont. June 23, 1903, he married Adele Sylvain, daughter of L. P.
Sylvain, of Ottawa, Chief Clerk in the Library of Parliament, with which
he has been connected since 1878. Two daughters and one son—Margaret,
Philip, and Adele—add joy and lustre to the home. Mr. Davis is a member

=Bâby, Wolstan Alexander Dixie=, Collector of Inland Revenue for the
Division of Hamilton (Ontario), is one of the most widely known and
respected of Federal Government officials. Moreover, he comes of one of
the oldest of all Canadian families and his ancestry dates back almost
to the beginnings of white settlement on the continent of North America.
He is the son of the late William Duperon Bâby, attorney-at-law and
sheriff of the County of Essex, Ont., and Christina Jane Wilson,
daughter of Captain John Wilson, of H.M. Canadian Militia, Amherstburg,
Ont., and was born at Sandwich, Ont., on April 13, 1858. As a matter of
record it is important to say something of the ancestry and family
history of Mr. Bâby. His forefathers came from France in the earlier
years of French settlement, and settled at Fort Detroit in what is now
the State of Michigan, but then part of the French domain of Canada.
Later they moved across the Detroit River, and took up land in what is
now the town of Sandwich, Ont. The founders of the family on this
continent were Jacques Bâby de Rainville and his wife, Isabeau Robin, of
Monteton, in the Bishopric of Agen, France. Jacques was an officer in
the famous Carignan Regiment and with it came to America in the
seventeenth century. Subsequently, in 1670, he was married a second time
to Jehanne Dandonneau de Sables, of which union were born nine children.
The eldest grandson of this couple was Hon. Jacques Duperon Bâby, who
was born in 1731, and lived until 1796. While he was still a young man,
the British conquest of Canada occurred, and Detroit falling into
British hands in 1760, Jacques Duperon Bâby and his wife, Suzanne de la
Croix Rheaume (who lived until 1812), became British subjects. In all
they had twenty-two children. The name of Hon. Jacques Duperon Bâby is
intimately interwoven with the history of the Essex peninsula. He played
a prominent part in the defence of the Detroit district during the
conspiracy of the Indian chieftain, Pontiac, in 1760. He was a man of
great worth and integrity, who enjoyed the confidence alike of the
French, English, and Indian population, and consequently was able to be
of great assistance to the British government in the establishment of
the new regime. Hon. Jacques Duperon Bâby was the eldest of his many
children. He was born in 1762 and died in 1833, and held positions of
honour and influence in the young colony of Upper Canada. Jean Baptiste
Bâby, grandfather of the subject of this sketch, was a younger brother,
and served as Treasurer of the newly-organized County of Essex. Two
other brothers entered the British army, one, Daniel, rising to the rank
of Major-General; while four of his sisters married British officers,
one of whom was Lord Bellingham. The eldest son of Jean Baptiste Bâby
was William Duperon Bâby, afterward sheriff of Essex, born at Sandwich
in 1819; and the subject of this sketch was William’s sixth child. Since
most of the various generations had large families, the Bâby family
connection in Western Ontario, and indeed throughout America is
literally enormous, and all have preserved the high tradition of
“noblesse oblige.” Mr. Dixie Bâby was educated at the Separate Schools
and at Assumption College, Sandwich, Ont., and at the Christian
Brothers’ School, Toronto, in 1876. At the age of eighteen he was
appointed to the Inland Revenue service, and detailed to Rae’s
distillery as assistant officer to the late Pierre Ramon. He qualified
himself so well as a vigilant watcher of the government interests in
connection with the important revenue derived from excise that he has
since served in many parts of Canada, including Paris, Woodstock, St.
Catharines, Belleville, Brantford, Portage la Prairie, and
Berthierville, Que. He was first stationed at Hamilton in 1886 as second
officer to the late William Donaghy, and in 1890 transferred to
Berthierville. In 1892 he went back to the Hamilton distillery, and was
appointed officer in charge in October, 1898. On November 21, 1914, he
was appointed Collector of Inland Revenue in charge of the entire
Hamilton division. His duties have always been of a character which
required expert knowledge as well as rigid probity, and during his
forty-three years’ service he has won the unfailing confidence of the
Department, no matter which party was in power. In December, 1880, he
married Mary McDougall, of Belleville, Ont., who was born April 7, 1861.
He has had seven children: Christina Caroline, deceased; Julia Fortier
and Mary Louisa (twins, also deceased); Frances Jeanette, wife of Henri
Bâby, notary public, Lachine, Que.; John Dixie; George Raymond; and
Madeline Cecilia. Capt. George Raymond Bâby, M.D., C.M., who was born at
Berthierville on April 1, 1892, went to France with the McGill
University 1915 unit, Canadian Army Medical Corps, and was awarded the
Military Cross for bravery and devotion to duty during the great British
advance which began August 8, 1918, and only ended when the armistice
was signed. The other son, John Dixie Bâby, is a civil engineer by
profession, who assisted in building the Canton Hankow Railway, China.

=Bell, Hon. George Alexander=, Chairman of the Local Government Board
for the Province of Saskatchewan, is one of the pubic administrators of
the Canadian West, and in an unusual degree the architect of his own
fortunes. He was born on a farm in Brant County, Ontario, on August 3,
1856, the son of David and Agnes (Melrose) Bell. He was educated in the
public schools of Huron County, and continued on the farm until he was
twenty years old, after which he learned the trade of blacksmith, which
he followed for the next twelve years, four in Ontario and eight in
Manitoba. He moved to the latter province in 1880 on the opening up of
that province by the Canadian Pacific Railway. In 1888 he engaged in the
agricultural implement business as agent for the Massey-Harris Company,
and continued therein for the next thirteen years. In 1903, because of
his exceptional knowledge of the country he was appointed by the
Dominion Government Homestead Inspector for the Land District of
Estevan, Saskatchewan, a position he resigned in 1908 to become a
candidate for the Saskatchewan Legislature, and was elected as a
supporter of the Liberal administration of Hon. Walter Scott. He was
re-elected for Estevan in 1912, and called to the Cabinet and sworn in
as Provincial Treasurer on August 19 of that year. The Government had
established a system of Government-owned telephones, and this portfolio
was shortly combined with his duties as Treasurer. In his second
capacity of Minister of Telephones he was sworn in February, 1913, and
continued to administer both offices until May, 1918, when he resigned
from the Cabinet and Legislature to accept the post of Chairman of the
Local Government Board, an important office, for which his
administrative capacity and thorough knowledge of Western conditions
eminently fit him. Mr. Bell is a Liberal in politics, and a Presbyterian
in religion. He is a member of the Wascana Country Club, Regina (his
favorite recreation being golf), and of the following societies: A.F. &
A.M., I.O.O.F., and C.O.F. On December 6, 1883, he married Elizabeth,
daughter of Johnston and Rachel (Cosgrove) Smith, of Elmwood, Bruce
County, Ont., and has seven children, George Melrose, Ella Mabel,
Gordon, Ethel, Grace Agnes, Lorne David, and Harold Alexander Bell. Mr.
and Mrs. Bell reside at Regina, Sask.

=Martin, Hon. William Melville, K.C.=, Prime Minister of Saskatchewan,
is a native of the village of Norwich, Oxford County, Ont. He was born
on August 23, 1877, the son of Rev. William M. and Christina (Jamieson)
Martin, both his parents being natives of Scotland. While he was very
young his parents removed to Exeter in Huron County, where his father
served as Minister of the Presbyterian Church for twenty-six years. The
subject of this sketch was educated at Exeter Public School, Clinton
Collegiate Institute, and the University of Toronto, from which
institution he graduated with the degree of B.A. and honors in classics.
He also attended the Ontario School of Pedagogy to qualify as a High
School teacher, and subsequently acted as Classical Master at Harriston
High School for two years, 1899-1901. This however he regarded but as a
stepping-stone to the practice of law for which he qualified at Osgoode
Hall, Toronto. On being called to the bar he went to Regina,
Saskatchewan, and commenced practice in July, 1903. He developed great
talent not only as a lawyer but as a public speaker, and soon became
prominent in the Liberal party. In 1906 he was offered the Liberal
nomination for the House of Commons, for the old riding of Western
Assiniboia, in succession to Hon. Walter Scott (who had resigned his
Ottawa seat to become the first Prime Minister of the newly organized
province of Saskatchewan), but declined. At the general elections of
1908, however, he yielded to the requests of his friends and accepted
nomination, being elected by a majority of 708. At the general elections
of 1911, despite the fact that the Liberal party as a whole met defeat,
he was elected by the increased majority of 1,730. In all he sat in the
House of Commons at Ottawa for eight years and although one of its
youngest members was regarded as one of the most brilliant. In 1916 Hon.
Walter Scott was obliged to resign the Premiership of Saskatchewan owing
to ill health and Mr. Martin’s party friends in the West urged that he
resign from Federal politics and accept the Premiership. He assented and
at a by-election on November 13, 1916, was returned for Mr. Scott’s
seat, Regina City, by acclamation. He reorganized the cabinet and framed
a programme of progressive legislation which proved so acceptable to the
electorate that at the general election of 1917 his administration was
sustained by a very handsome majority. In addition to the offices of
Prime Minister and President of the Council he administers the
portfolios of Minister of Education and Minister of Railways. His
educational reforms, covering as they do many problems of extreme
moment, have been very important, and have attracted wide attention
throughout Canada, and in the United States as well. Generally speaking
Saskatchewan legislation under his regime has won fame for progress and
effectiveness. So widespread is his reputation that on the death of Sir
Wilfrid Laurier, early in 1919, many, both in the East and West,
suggested him as the best available successor to the Federal Liberal
leadership. Many of his friends still predict a Federal career for him,
although Mr. Martin himself prefers to see his own programme of

=Henry, David Edouard=, founder of Henry’s Shorthand School, 209 Sparks
Street, Ottawa, on January 2, 1913, was born at Clarence Creek, Russell
County, Ontario, April 24, 1874, his parents being Jacques Henry, a
farmer, and Aurelie Laviolette. He was educated in Ottawa at the Grey
Nuns’ Convent and the Christian Brothers’ School. Building it on a sure
foundation—according to the laws of economics, well equipped, and
capably managed by experts—Mr. Henry made his school an enviable
success. At the opening in 1913, the school was located at the corner of
Bank and Gloucester Streets, and within three months, having outgrown
its original premises it was removed to its present premises on the
corner of Sparks and Bank Streets—the Capital’s busy corner—which from
time to time have been enlarged as the requirements of increased
attendance demanded until to-day they are some five times the original
size, and are likely to be enlarged still further at an early date,
although his school is to-day the largest in Eastern Ontario. When the
school was transferred from the corner of Bank and Gloucester Streets to
the corner of Bank and Sparks, Mr. Henry had but 40 day pupils. In 1918,
the number had increased to 562, which students are to-day holding good
positions in the Dominion Government offices, manufacturing and
wholesale establishments, banking houses, etc., all of which bears
tribute to the high standard of efficiency of the school. For eleven
years before Mr. Henry went into business for himself, he was in charge
of the shorthand department of the Willis Business College in Ottawa,
when S. T. Willis was proprietor. In his school, his staff consists of
experts in shorthand, typewriting, business penmanship, practical
English, spelling, punctuation, transcription, correspondence, etc.,
etc., and those who receive instruction in any one of these receive the
best that can be had. At the age of 16 years, Mr. Henry was awarded a
Fourth Form Certificate and honours for composition, spelling and
penmanship. He acquired a systematic course of self-instruction, studied
shorthand (French system) and afterwards English, and made himself
proficient in the Isaac Pitman, Ben Pitman, Graham, Munson,
Scott-Browne, Beale, Calligraphy (a Canadian production), and the Gregg
systems. He studied French, English, German, Greek and Latin, and
received special study in penmanship at the Zanerian College, Columbus,
Ohio. To acquire a practical business education, he had experience as
stenographer and bookkeeper with big business firms such as Perkins &
Fraser, barristers; Alexander Mutchmor, auditor, etc. From 1894 to 1896,
Mr. Henry made a special study of scientific methods for imparting
shorthand and typewriting, and during 1895-6 taught shorthand at the
Capital City Business College, at Ottawa, and had charge of the Y.M.C.A.
classes for several months. In 1896, he attended the Rochester, New
York, Business Institute, to acquire a greater qualification for
teaching, and, in 1899, established a shorthand school, which later he
closed to join the staff of the Metropolitan Business College at Ottawa.
For two years, he attended Rev. Dr. McMeekin’s “Ottawa College of
Oratory,” and gave several successful recitals in the Albert Hall. In
1899, Mr. Henry corrected a text book on Pitman’s shorthand for Messrs.
Powers and Lyons, of Chicago, Illinois. Mr. Henry is a graduate of the
New York College of Phonography; the Phonographic Institute, Cincinnati,
Ohio; and is the only personal graduate in Canada of the well known
Gregg School of Chicago. He holds the Scott-Browne’s Certificate. In his
examination for the Phonographic Institute Teacher’s Certificate, he
made the highest record, viz., 97.2 per cent., thereby defeating more
than 700 candidates. Mr. Henry is a member of the Gregg Shorthand
Association of America, and is the author of two standard works in
shorthand. Mr. Henry is a Roman Catholic in religion, a Liberal in
politics, and, for recreation, spends his time motoring. He resides at
205 O’Connor Street, Ottawa, Ontario.

=Gibbon, Arthur Playford=, Principal of the Central Business College,
Hamilton, Ont., is one of Canada’s leading commercial educationists. He
was born on April 7, 1871, in a log house in the township of Nichol,
Wellington County, Ont., the son of William and Susan (Reynolds) Gibbon.
His early education was received in the rural school of his section, and
later he walked four miles night and morning to attend the High School
and Model School at Elora. From January, 1892, to July, 1894, he taught
in rural ungraded schools, after which he returned to the farm for five
years to care for his father and mother. Deciding to equip himself as a
commercial teacher he took a course at Stratford Business College, and
after graduation taught in that institution for six months. In 1901, he
went to Woodstock, Ont., to take the post of junior commercial teacher,
and after one year became senior in these subjects. In 1904, he became
Principal, and under his guidance built up the institution into one of
the most important of its kind in Western Ontario. In Woodstock he also
took an active part in public and business affairs. He acted as auditor
for several large commercial houses, and sat in the municipal council as
alderman. In the latter capacity his business acumen and sound judgment
made him one of the most useful of public servants. His faculty for
acquiring knowledge of every detail of civic business made him very
valuable in the consideration of measures for the city’s welfare, so
that when in August, 1909, he decided to leave Woodstock, expressions of
regret were universal. In Woodstock, also, he became very active in the
temperance cause, and served as Secretary-Treasurer of the North Oxford
Prohibition Association. As Treasurer of the local branch of the
Y.M.C.A., he rendered very important service in connection with the
erection of new buildings, and he was very prominent in church work as a
member of the Methodist body. In 1909, he sold his interest in Woodstock
Business College, and bought Clark’s Business College at Hamilton, Ont.
When he took charge on January 1, 1910, the attendance at the
institution was but 34 day and 28 night students. He changed the name to
the Central Business College, and within a few years his powers of
organization had built up the attendance to five times the original
figure. Mr. Gibbon’s chief hobby is Sunday School work, and he has
served as a religious teacher of the young for over thirty years, in the
various places where he has lived. His spirit of enterprise and
attractive personality make him an ideal influence on youth. He is a
member of the Kiwanis Club, Hamilton, and of the following fraternal
societies, I.O.O.F., A.F. & A.M., Royal Templars of Temperance, and the
Orange Order. On November 6, 1901, he married Margaret H. Lacey, and has
two children, Playford Sutherland Gibbon and Ada Margaret Gibbon.

=Webber, John A.=, Assistant Postmaster, Hamilton, Ont., was born in the
township of Binbrook, Wentworth County, December 10th, 1861, the son of
Esau Webber, contractor, Hamilton, Ont., and his wife Isabella (Ledmon)
Webber. He was educated at the Hamilton Public Schools and Hamilton
Collegiate Institute, was appointed to the Civil Service as a clerk in
the Hamilton Post Office, October 24, 1881, advancing steadily till, in
June, 1918, he was appointed to his present position by the Civil
Service Commission, an appointment received with general satisfaction by
the press and business men of Hamilton, and one of the earliest
important promotions made by the Civil Service Commission. He married on
June 1, 1886, Helena S. Murray, daughter of John J. Murray (M.D. Trinity
College, Dublin), of Waterdown, and has two daughters, Ada A., wife of
R. H. Moore, Cleveland, Ohio, and Charlotte I. Mr. Webber is a member of
the Canadian Club, President Hamilton Horticultural Society,
Vice-President Hamilton Garden Club, Director of Ontario Horticultural
Society, representing Niagara District, member of the Executive Council
Hamilton Scientific Association, member of the Canadian Order of
Foresters, life member of Canadian Red Cross, and a sustaining member of
the Hamilton Health Association (Mountain Sanitary). He is an Anglican,
and a member of the Executive Board of St. Thomas Church. Outside of his
agreeable manner, intense activity is Mr. Webber’s outstanding
characteristic, and his principal recreation seems to be in always doing
things, and doing them well and cheerfully. Alluding to his appointment,
“The Civilian” (organ of the Civil Service), says: “In the appointment
of Mr. John A. Webber as assistant postmaster at Hamilton, we have
another instance of the application of the merit system as inaugurated
by the Civil Service Commission. He was appointed to the staff on
October 24, 1881, and has risen from junior clerk to almost head by
efficient work, his standing in all Departmental examinations being very
high. For ten years before his present appointment, he acted as
Superintendent of the office, filling the assistant postmaster’s place
during Mr. Matthews’ absence, and while in these positions his courteous
and prompt attention to the needs of the public made him a host of
friends in the business world with whom the appointment is very popular.
As to the staff, the appointment is equally popular, every man knowing
that under Mr. Webber any grievance is sure of a fair hearing and a just
decision in the matter.” Mr. Webber’s father was a prominent contractor
in the 50’s, 60’s and 70’s, during which period he erected many public
buildings and business blocks, among which were St. Mary’s Cathedral,
Centenary Church, Masonic Hall, Lester Block and hundreds of stores,
hotels and private dwellings. While carrying on the contracting business
during the period of food shortage, following the Crimean War, he bought
and operated a 200-acre farm in the county on which the subject of this
sketch was born but only remained during infancy. During the Great War
Mr. Webber took an active part in patriotic, Red Cross and Relief Work,
and in his long connection as director, and for several years in
succession President of the Hamilton Horticultural Society. Has
contributed not a little to the beautifying of home surroundings
throughout the city. In his connection with the Gordon Club and in the
eight counties under his jurisdiction as director of the Ontario
Horticultural Society he did much to stimulate the production of
vegetables and other foods throughout the district during the war. His
efforts in the direction received commendation from the President of the
National War Garden Commissioner, Washington, D.C., for adding to the
world’s supply of food during the war. Mr. Webber lives at 130 Stinson
Street, where he delights in Horticulture.

=Campbell, William Brough.= The late W. B. Campbell, of Toronto,
insurance publisher and editor, was of Scottish extraction and was born
in Shannonville, Ontario (then Canada West), on July 17, 1854. He was
the eldest of four children who reached maturity. While he was still a
child, his parents removed with their family to Toronto, where he
continued to reside until his death. He was educated in the public
schools, and went to work while still only a lad, serving under his
father, who held an administrative position in the Toronto office of the
old Lancashire Fire Insurance Company. About 1880 he joined his father
in the publication of a monthly insurance journal called “The Budget.”
From its first issue the new paper was independent in policy and
aggressive in tone, and its strictures upon some of the loose practices
of insurance companies, and especially its denunciations of wild-cat
concerns carrying on a business of plunder in the name of insurance,
made it a power in its field. A fairly extensive printing business was
developed as a side line of the business, but ultimately this proved too
complex a load for the periodical to carry. The result was that other
people acquired the rights in “The Budget.” But the Campbells, father
and son, at once came out with a new venture, “The Bulletin,” virtually
a continuation of the old. In 1905, feeling the need of greater freedom
in editorial and business policy than his surroundings permitted, Mr.
Campbell dissociated himself from his father, and began the publication
of “Office and Field,” a weekly—in its time the only weekly journal in
the world wholly devoted to life insurance. The world-wide upheaval in
life insurance business arising from the investigation by a committee of
the legislature of the State of New York in 1905 threatened the new
venture with early extinction, but by daring and skilful guidance Mr.
Campbell brought his craft to success. He demanded and insisted upon
service of the public as the one justification for life insurance. It
was largely through his influence that the life insurance agents were
organized as the Life Underwriters’ Association of Canada, an
institution which, carrying out the policy which he and other leaders
laid down, has achieved a splendid success. His work, both as editor and
propagandist was a distinct factor in making life insurance in Canada
the great financial and social force it has become. Mr. Campbell was
married in September, 1887, to Jessie G., eldest daughter of the late
George Maclean Rose. Of this union there were born two daughters and a
son. The son, Wilfrid Maclean Campbell answered the call to the colours,
and served as a private in France and Flanders from February, 1916, to
the end. He was one of the glorious Canadians at Vimy Ridge, was wounded
at Hill 70, but returned to the ranks, and was among those who marched
as victors into Germany. Too great devotion to business broke down Mr.
Campbell’s health, and after a short illness he died in June, 1914, in
his sixtieth year.

for the Minister of Justice of Canada on the mainland of British
Columbia. In 1898, he was elected to the Provincial Legislature as
member for the city of New Westminster, and sat for two years. In 1899,
he became Attorney-General for British Columbia, and in 1901 was
appointed judge of the County Court of Vancouver, an office he held
until 1907, when he was appointed Commissioner of the Yukon Territory.
For four years he lived at Dawson City, and won distinction by his wise
and able administration. In 1911, he resigned, and resumed the practise
of law at Vancouver, where he has a large and lucrative practice. He has
taken an active interest in military affairs, and was formerly major of
the 6th Regiment, Duke of Connaught’s Rifles, and was placed on the
Reserve of Officers in 1907. His recreation is rifle shooting, and he
accompanied the Canadian Bisley Team to England in 1901, acting as
adjutant. He is a Presbyterian in religion, a Liberal in politics, and a
member of the Vancouver Club. On September 14, 1895, he married Susan
Crawford, daughter of William McCraney, of Oakville, Ont., and
Vancouver, B.C. The latter was a very prominent lumberman, and formerly
represented Halton (Ontario) in the House of Commons. Mr. and Mrs.
Henderson have one daughter, Grace Kilpatrick Henderson, and reside at

=Reid, William Brown=, President and Managing Director of United Cigar
Stores, Ltd., of Canada, with head office at 284 King Street West,
Toronto, Ont., was born in Rothes, Scotland, April 7, 1866, the son of
Alexander and Helen (Simpson) Reid. His father was an extensive and
prosperous farmer, and this afforded the subject of this sketch the
opportunity of exercising in his boyhood his innate love of horses which
he still retains. While afforded, like other members of his family, all
the facilities for pursuing the highest educational course, he was
satisfied with that of the common schools which have produced so many
successful Scotchmen. He served with the Rothes (Elginshire) Volunteers
from 1882 till 1888, when he came to Canada, and shortly afterwards
joined the 48th Highlanders, serving for five years. After leaving
school he pursued his own inclinations, and before coming to Canada had
gained practical experience in a general way, besides having
considerable knowledge along useful technical lines as a reserve to fall
back on. In 1888, he became connected with the Empire Tobacco Co., with
which he remained as Toronto representative till 1897, when he
established in Toronto the wholesale tobacco and Cigar firm of W. B.
Reid & Co., which was the foundation of the present extensive
corporation of which he was the originator, and has always been the head
and controlling genius. The firm was incorporated as the United Cigar
Stores, Limited, in 1902, with a capital of $20,000, and opened several
cigar stores in Toronto. In May, 1914, the company’s capital stock was
increased to $250,000, and the number of stores largely increased and
extended to outside cities. A year later, United Cigar Stores, Limited,
of Canada was incorporated with a capital of $3,800,000, with Mr. Reid
still in full control. The Company now has 164 stores, extending from
Quebec City to Port Arthur, including 39 in Toronto, 13 in Ottawa, 11 in
Hamilton, and one or more in almost every important town in the
province. Remarkable as this achievement is in so short a time, it falls
far short of the goal set by Mr. Reid, who intends to have stores in
every city and town of consequence in the Dominion, and no doubt would
have already made this goal an established fact before now if the war
had not put a temporary stop to further expansion. Besides operating
this great chain of stores, the company has two large cigar factories,
and as a holding company, also controls a chain of Drug Stores with
about a dozen branches, and a constantly and rapidly increasing
business. The annual turnover of the cigar stores and cigar factories is
between $3,000,000 and $4,000,000, all directed by Mr. Reid personally
from the head office. This immense volume of business enables the
company to buy goods in such large quantities that it obtains better
terms than are available by small purchasers, and at the same time
minimizes the percentage of overhead expenses. Mr. Reid married Edith E.
Rogers, daughter of A. C. Rogers, Newmarket, Ont., November 8, 1896. He
is a member of the Toronto and Montreal Boards of Trade, of the
Scarborough Golf Club, Lakeview Golf, Mississauga Golf and Ontario
Clubs; member of the A.F. & A.M., a Presbyterian, and independent in
politics. His chief recreations are bowling and golf. He resides at 42
Lakeview Ave., Toronto. Mr. Reid is genial in manner, a systematic
organizer, with sufficient of the imaginative faculty to prompt
enterprise and enough determination and reserve force to ensure the
carrying out of anything to which he lays his hand. He was the first man
in the province of Ontario to place on the market the product of
Canadian grown tobacco, and the expansion of this business has proven
his foresight beyond question. The great war made heavy drafts on the
staff of the Company, but Mr. Reid is too good a Britisher to complain
of that; in fact, in addition to contributing thousands of dollars to
patriotic purposes, so strong along this line is he that he never has
allowed any foreign element to obtain a footing in his company, which he
says will be strictly Canadian, without outside influence, so long as he
is at its head—and that means as long as he desires to remain in active
business.

=Johnson, Hon. Thomas Herman, B.A., LL.D.=, Attorney-General of
Manitoba, is a type of those Icelandic Canadians who, going into the
West in the early days, have done so much for its development. He was
born in Iceland on February 12, 1870, the son of John and Margaret
Johnson. When he was a boy of eight years old his father resolved to try
his fortunes in the virgin country of Western Canada, and settled in
Manitoba as a farmer, bringing his family with him. The subject of this
sketch was from early boyhood bent on a professional career. He attended
the public schools of Winnipeg, and later took a course at Gustavus
Adolphus College, Minnesota, from which he graduated in 1895 with the
degree of B.A. As a youth he taught school during the summer in the
Glenboro district to secure funds to continue his studies during the
winter. After obtaining his degree he entered the legal offices of
Richards (afterwards Mr. Justice Richards) and Bradshaw, with a view to
qualifying himself for the law. He was admitted to the Manitoba Bar in
1900, and immediately commenced practice at Winnipeg. His abilities and
knowledge of the different races of Manitoba were such that in 1901 the
Laurier administration appointed him census commissioner for Manitoba to
take the decennial census of that year. In 1904 he was elected as member
of the Winnipeg School Board, and continued to act until 1907, when he
resigned to stand as Liberal candidate for the Legislature in the riding
of West Winnipeg. He was successful, and was also re-elected in 1910. At
the general elections of 1914 he was Liberal candidate in Centre
Winnipeg, and was again successful. As a prominent member of the
opposition, he took an active part in the campaign which resulted in
driving the Roblin administration from office. In 1915, when the
Liberals, under Hon. Mr. Norris, came into power, he was again elected
for Centre Winnipeg, and on the formation of the Norris government was
offered, and accepted, the post of Minister of Public Works.
Subsequently, he was transferred to the more important portfolio of
Attorney-General. Mr. Johnson is a fine public speaker, and his
shrewdness and judgment on all public questions are highly esteemed by
his fellow citizens and colleagues in the Legislature. He is a Lutheran
in religion, and his chief recreation is golf. On June 21, 1898, he
married Aurora, daughter of F. Frederickson, merchant, Glenboro,
Manitoba, and has three children, M. Ethel, Elswood B., and Cecil F.
Johnson.

=Farrow, Robinson Russell=, Assistant Commissioner of Customs, was born
at Bluevale, Huron County, Ontario, March 7, 1864, and was educated at
the public schools in Huron. He is the son of Thomas Farrow, (who came
to Canada from England in 1849, and for years was Superintendent of
Schools for Wawanosh, Morris and Turnberry, and who, establishing
himself in business, made progress and prospered as the country advanced
in population, industry and wealth), and Mary Macdonald, of London,
Ontario. His father also became popular in the County of Huron, and at
the general election in 1872 was chosen to represent North Huron in the
House of Commons. He was re-elected at the general election in 1876, and
again at the general election in 1882 was the successful candidate for
East Huron. June 1, 1881, Mr. Farrow first entered the Civil Service of
Canada in the Customs Department, and May 8, 1907, was appointed
Assistant Commissioner. In lawn bowling and curling, Mr. Farrow holds a
prominent station for competency, and is ever sought when championship
contests are listed. He usually carries his team to victory. He is
honorary President of the Ontario Lawn Bowling Association; member of
the Executive of the Dominion Lawn Bowling Association; Past President
of the Ottawa Lawn Bowling Club; and a member of the Finance Committee
of the Ottawa Curling Club. In his official capacity as Assistant
Commissioner, he is one of the busiest men in the Civil Service, and one
of the most competent, coupled with which there is an ever evident
promptness in action and courtesy in manner. January 5, 1887, Mr. Farrow
married Miss R. J. Bradley, daughter of Samuel T. Bradley, a mill owner,
and Margaret Alexander, of Huntley, Ontario. Mr. Farrow has one
daughter—Ethel, B.A. (now Mrs. C. H. Bland), whose son, Corpl. C. H.
Bland, B.A., served during the world war in the 20th Battery, Overseas
Forces, and was with the army of occupation in Germany; and Bombdr.
Russell Farrow, who, with the 20th Battery, C.E.S., served in France,
Belgium, and with the army of occupation in Germany. Mr. Farrow belongs
to the Laurentian Club, and is a member of the following societies:
Scottish Rite Masons; A.F. & A.M.; Oddfellows; A.O.U.W.; Canadian Order
of Foresters; Sons of England. He resides at 7 McLeod Street, Ottawa,
Ont., and he attends the Methodist Church.

=Veale, Philip Henry=, Assessment Commissioner for the City of Ottawa,
was appointed to that position February 5, 1917. He is well known among
Canadian municipal officials and civic legislators as a reliable
authority on assessments, both as to the application of the Ontario
Assessment and Local Improvement Acts, and as to land values, of which
he has been a close student. Prior to his appointment as Assessment
Commissioner, there were, besides the Commissioner, an Assistant
Commissioner; and when Mr. Veale was appointed the latter position was
abolished, the civic government considering that in the new appointment
they had secured a man who was competent to perform the duties alone,
although the responsibilities and duties of the office had increased
considerably, and were daily increasing. That they were not mistaken is
amply proved by the fact that the affairs of the Assessment
Commissioner’s office were never working in such regular clock-like form
as they are to-day. When Mr. Veale first became an employee in the
Assessment Commissioner’s Office in 1892, the taxable assessment of the
city of Ottawa was but $18,236,160, and the population only 43,942. In
1919—twenty-seven years later—the taxable assessment had increased to
$114,392,261, and the population to 104,007; and, strange to say, of all
the aldermen who were in the city council at that time, but one man,
Alderman (now Controller) Napoleon Champagne, is still in civic life,
and most of the others have crossed the line and joined the great
majority. Mr. Veale has contributed largely to newspapers and magazines
on assessment and other like important subjects, and few, if any, are
better able to handle such subjects in newspaper discussion than he. It
was in the re-organization of the civic assessment department in 1892
that Mr. Veale was appointed to a clerkship. It was not long before he
was appointed chief clerk, and then Assistant Commissioner; and when Mr.
William Stewart retired in 1917, Mr. Veale was called upon to assume the
duties and responsibilities of both offices. Besides being an authority
on real estate values, Mr. Veale is well known in Eastern Ontario as a
breeder of White Wyandotte chickens, as a consistent exhibitor and
prize-winner. At his summer home. River Park, every year he raises
hundreds of thoroughbred fowl. Mr. Veale is the son of Philip Veale, who
for many years was manager of the Dominion Fisheries at Ottawa, and Jane
(Smith) Veale. He was born at Merrickville, Ontario, January 7, 1865,
and was educated in the public school, New Edinburgh, now a portion of
Ottawa. On April 27, 1887, Mr. Veale married Emma M. Payne, daughter of
Abraham Payne, civil servant, Ottawa, resulting in a fine family of nine
children—seven girls and two boys—Ethel Alberta, Mabel Mildred,
Kathleen Gwendeline, Philip McDougal, Beatrice Jean, Albert Newell,
Annie Edna, Lois Evelene, Constance Winifred. Mr. Veale is a member of
the following clubs and societies: St. George’s, Sons of England, Knight
of the Maccabees, and St. Matthew’s Church Men’s. In religion he is an
Anglican, in politics a Conservative, and his recreations are fishing,
and amateur gardening. His residence is at Woodroffe, Ont.

=Finlayson, George Daniel, B.A., A.I.A.=, is the son of Edward
Finlayson, a farmer who was born at Merigomish, N.S., and Catherine
(Smith) Finlayson, and a brother of Professor J. N. Finlayson of
Dalhousie University, Halifax. Mr. Finlayson was born in Merigomish,
Pictou County, Nova Scotia, December 31, 1882, and received his
education in the country school, Merigomish, Pictou Academy, and
Dalhousie University, graduating in 1907 with B.A. and great
distinction. On May 6, 1907, Mr. Finlayson entered upon his duties in
connection with the Dominion Insurance Department, and at once became a
valuable acquisition to the staff of that branch of the Civil Service.
It was not long before his great ability as an authority on, and his
general knowledge of, all phases of insurance brought him prominently to
the notice of the Ottawa authorities and the heads of insurance
companies throughout Canada, and his promotion, as a consequence, was
rapid. Seven years later, from the time he entered the service on
September 1, 1914, and at the early age of 32 years, he was appointed to
the highest position in the Insurance Department, viz., that of
Superintendent, which position he holds to-day. In the execution of his
duties, he is noted for his courtesy to all who seek information from
him. In 1914, Mr. Finlayson married Isabel M. Grant, daughter of A. M.
Grant, of Moncton, New Brunswick, and has one daughter, Catherine Smith
Finlayson, and one son. Mr. Finlayson is a member of the Canadian,
University, and Riverside Golf clubs. For recreation he indulges in
tennis, golf and walking. He is a Presbyterian in religion, and his
residence is 200 Carling Avenue, Ottawa.

North-West Mounted Police, since 1917, was born December 17, 1854, at
Belfast, Prince Edward Island, and received his education at the Prince
of Wales College, Charlottetown, P.E.I., and Harvard Law School. He is
the son of William and Flora McLean, both of Prince Edward Island.
Having read law in the office of the late Chief Justice, Hon. Sir
William Sullivan, Mr. McLean was called to the bar in 1876, and became a
partner in the law firm of Sullivan, McLean & Morsen. Afterwards he was
senior member of McLean & McKinnon, barristers and solicitors, Victoria
Row, Charlottetown, P.E.I. In June, 1894, he was appointed Q.C., and
revising officer for East Queen’s, and was elected President of the
P.E.I. Law Society. For eight years, Mr. McLean was law clerk for the
P.E.I. Legislature, and was Official Assignee under the old Dominion
Insolvent Act for five years. During 1888, 1889 and 1900, Mr. McLean
represented the constituency of Belfast in the P.E.I. Legislature. He
was a candidate at the by-elections of 1902 and 1904 for the House of
Commons, and was elected at the General Election of 1904. In the General
Election of 1908 he was defeated, but in 1911 was elected by a large
majority. October 15, 1917, he was appointed controller of the Royal
North-West Mounted Police. In June 14, 1882, Mr. McLean married Leah
Yeo, daughter of the late John Yeo, of Charlottetown. She died in 1897.

=Robertson, Hon. Gideon Decker, P.C.=, Federal Minister of Labor, was
the first actual representative of organized labor to be called to
either the Dominion Cabinet or the Senate of Canada, He was born at
Welland, Ont., on August 26, 1874, the son of Gavin E. Robertson and
Laretto Goring, both native Canadians. His paternal grandfather was a
native of Scotland, who became a member of the bar and later went to
Jamaica, where he took an active part in the agitation for the abolition
of slavery, which became a fully accomplished fact in 1838. In this
movement Robertson was in correspondence with Clarkson, Macaulay (father
of Lord Macaulay), Wilberforce and others active in freeing the British
Empire from this reproach. Later, he came to Canada, where Gavin
Robertson, father of the subject of this sketch, was born, and where he
became a farmer and school teacher on the Niagara peninsula. Gideon
Decker Robertson was educated at the public and high schools of Welland
and as a youth took up telegraphy in connection with railroad work. A
strong believer in trades unionism, he soon became active in the Order
of Railroad Telegraphers, an international body, of which he was some
years ago elected Vice-President, an office he still holds. His duties
brought him in contact with the chiefs of organized labor on this
continent, and he won a high reputation for clear thinking and executive
ability. In 1917, when Sir Robert Borden decided to abolish party lines
and form a Union Government, he offered Mr. Robertson a position in the
Senate and a seat in his Cabinet. The offer was accepted, and in the
autumn of that year he was sworn in as a member of the Privy Council and
a Minister without Portfolio. In May, 1918, he was appointed Chairman of
the sub-Committee of the Council on Labor Problems, and also Chairman of
the National Registration Board in connection with the war. On November
7, 1918, he was sworn in as Minister of Labor in succession to Hon. T.
W. Crothers, who had announced his intention of retiring some months
previously. The appointment was made just at the psychological moment,
for the armistice, which had been signed just one week previously,
created a host of labor problems more serious than Canada had ever
previously been called upon to face; and only a statesman enjoying
practical knowledge and the confidence of organized labor could have
dealt with the situation. In the spring and summer of 1919 he was called
upon to combat a conspiracy affecting all Canada to introduce a modified
form of Russian Bolshevism, fathered by the Industrial Workers of the
World, known as the “One Big Union.” The aim was to unite all existing
labor organizations in one body, and by sympathetic strikes and a policy
of terrorism destroy capitalism, and reduce all other classes to
subjection. This movement came to a head with a general strike called in
Winnipeg early in May, on the pretext of a dispute between the metal
workers and their employers. Winnipeg was chosen as a strategic point,
because of its peculiar geographical position as the chief divisional
point of three transcontinental railways. The aim was to cut Canada in
two in the matter of communications, and then by broadening the strike
Eastward and Westward secure complete control of Canadian transportation
and industry, after which the movement was to be carried into every
section of the United States. Senator Robertson himself went to the
scene of operations, and by his fearless, though moderate handling of
the situation, and his influence with the saner labor elements, rendered
the conspiracy abortive so far as the rest of Canada was concerned, and
fruitless in Winnipeg. He thus secured a triumph for legitimate trade
unionism, of which he is the chief sponsor in Canada. He is a Freemason,
a Presbyterian, and in politics a member of the Independent Labor Party.
On June 10, 1896, he married Mary Berry Hay, daughter of Alexander Hay,
Watford, Ont., and has six children—Edwin J., John McElroy, Gain
Elliot, Alexander Lorne, Mabel Letitia, and Alma Lauretta. He formerly
resided at Welland but his home is now at Ottawa.

=Hutchison, Col. William= (Ottawa, Ont.), the subject of this sketch,
was born in New Edinburgh in 1843, a suburb of the city of Ottawa. He
was educated in the Public and Grammar Schools. When about seventeen
years of age Col. Hutchison commenced to learn the Milling business with
his uncle, the late Thos. McKay, who was then owner of the McKay Mills
at the Chaudiere and also a partner in the New Edinburgh Mills. At the
age of twenty Col. Hutchison left for the United States where he
followed the milling business for several years. On his return he took
charge of his uncle’s business and shortly afterwards was made a
partner. In 1885 he was elected to City Council, and served for seven
years. It was during Col. Hutchison’s service in the City Council that
the question of the proper drainage of the city attained its greatest
importance, and it is owing to his keen foresight and wise counsel and
persistence that Ottawa to-day has the excellent drainage system of
which it now boasts, and that is but one of the many happenings for the
benefit, progress and beautification of Ottawa that were brought into
existence through his instrumentality during his term of office in the
City’s Civic affairs. From 1888 to, and including the year 1905, a
period of eighteen years, Col. Hutchison was a member of the Board of
Directors of the Central Canada Exhibition Association, and from 1895 to
1905, 10 years, he was President. On retiring in 1906 he was elected
Honorary President of the Association and has been re-elected to that
position every year since. Col. Hutchison, with the assistance of
Messrs. Ahearn and Topper, was instrumental in converting the old horse
car line to electric, giving Ottawa one of the best street car services
on the continent. He ran for the Dominion House in 1896, with the result
that both he and his French colleague, Napoleon A. Belcourt, were
elected by a sweeping majority. At the time the Conservatives felt that
they had a serious grievance, but ere long the good-hearted,
good-natured and genial new Member became the friend and companion of
both Liberals and Conservatives in the House of Commons. In 1901, when
Sir Wilfrid Laurier needed a competent man to travel to all parts of the
world to exhibit Canada’s mineral, cereal and industrial resources, Col.
Hutchison was asked to accept the position of Canadian Exhibition
Commissioner. He accepted and since his appointment he has had charge of
Canada’s exhibits at the following times and places:—1901, Buffalo,
U.S.A.; 1902, Osaka, Japan; 1903-04 St. Louis, U.S.A.; 1905, Liege,
Belgium; 1906, Milan, Italy; 1907, Dublin, Ireland; 1908, Shepherds
Bush, London, England; 1909, Seattle, U.S.A.; 1910, Brussels, Belgium;
1911-12, Crystal Palace, London, England; 1913, Ghent, Belgium; 1914-15,
San Francisco, U.S.A.; 1916-17, San Diego, U.S.A. The great world war
has caused a cessation of the valuable exhibits, but the whole display
is located in commodious quarters on Wellington St. in Ottawa, under
Col. Hutchison’s special care, waiting and ready to be shipped at a
moment’s notice. In 1902 Col. Hutchison was decorated by the Emperor of
Japan with the Order of the Rising Sun (with rank of Colonel in the
Army). In 1905 he was decorated by the late King Leopold II. of Belgium,
with the Order of Leopold, and in 1906 by the King of Italy with the
Order of the Crown of Italy, in 1910 he was made Commander of the Order
of the Crown of Belgium by King Albert I. Col. William Hutchison is the
son of the late Robert Hutchison of Ayrshire, Scotland, who came to
Canada in 1830 and in New Edinburgh married Mary McKay, niece of the
late Hon. Thos. McKay, who was born in Edinburgh, Scotland. In
September, 1874, he married Electa Blanche, daughter of S. T. Willett of
Chambly, Quebec. Two sons have blessed the union. In religion he is a
Presbyterian, and in politics a high tariff Liberal. He is also a member
of the Rideau Club, Ottawa, and his residence is 443 Albert St., Ottawa.

=Gibson, Brigadier-General Sir John Morison, K.C.M.G., M.A., LL.D.,
K.C.=, born January 1, 1842, township of Toronto, in the County of Peel,
and is therefore a “Peel Old Boy.” His father, William Gibson, a farmer,
came from Glamis, Forfarshire, Scotland, in 1827. His mother, Mary
Sinclair, was born in Scotland. Her people had settled in the township
of Nelson, in the County of Halton. The family removed from Toronto
township when the subject of this sketch was only eight or nine years of
age to the County of Haldimand, where he had some experience in the Log
School House education of the primitive settlements of that County in
the early 50’s. He afterwards went to the Central School in Hamilton,
the late Dr. Sangster then being Superintendent and Head Master. In due
course, and working against great disadvantages, he became head boy of
the public schools of Hamilton, a position which he maintained until he
passed the matriculation examination of the University of Toronto in
1859. As head boy of the school, he with the second boy, was selected to
open the waterworks system of the city of Hamilton in 1858. His course
at the University was a very successful one, taking scholarships all the
way through the various years, and graduating in 1863 as the highest
honor graduate with the Prince of Wales Prize, then given for general
proficiency, including honors at graduation, the Silver Medals in
Classics and Modern Languages, and the prize in Oriental languages,
including Hebrew, Chaldee and Syriac. After taking his B.A. degree, he
commenced the study of law in the office of the late Sir George Burton
in Hamilton, at the same time taking the law course of the University,
and receiving the degree of LL.B. in 1869 with the gold medal. One thing
of note in connection with General Gibson’s life is that he has always
endeavored to repay the educational institutions from which he received
his education. For many years he was a member of the Board of Education
in Hamilton, and was its Chairman for two years. During that time the
Collegiate Institute was brought into prominence as one of the leading
secondary educational institutions of the country. He served as a
Senator of the University of Toronto, being elected at the first
election of graduates in 1873 and re-elected in 1878 and 1883. He
subsequently founded a general proficiency scholarship for matriculation
candidates. When a student of the University during the Trent affair, he
joined the University Rifles, being one of the first to sign the roll of
that company in 1860. He has been in the Militia ever since, for now
nearly 59 years, and at the present time is the senior officer in the
Canadian Force among all who are not following military life as their
regular occupation. In 1863, he transferred to the 13th, and has served
from private up through all the ranks to the position of commanding
officer, which position he held for 9 years, and at the present time is
the Honorary Colonel of that corps. He was present at Ridgeway as a
lieutenant. He subsequently commanded the 15th Brigade, having
headquarters at Hamilton, and later on at the beginning of the great war
received the rank of Brigadier-General. As a marksman he always has had
a very high reputation, having been a member Canadian Wimbledon teams in
1874, ’75, and ’79, being a frequent prize winner, and taking the much
coveted Prince of Wales prize in the last-named year. He took part in
several of the early international long range rifle contests with
British, Australian, and American rifle teams. In 1881 he commanded the
team which defeated the British team in the competition for the Kolapore
Cup. He was president for three years of the Ontario Rifle Association,
was also President of the Canadian Military Rifle League, and from 1893
for thirteen or fourteen years was President of the Dominion Rifle
Association. In 1907 he again commanded the Canadian rifle team at
Bisley. He has also been President of the Canadian Military Institute,
and was President of the Canadian Red Cross Society from its original
organization throughout the South African War, and subsequently for a
period of about 14 years, and has been throughout the recent great war
one of the most active members of the Executive Board. He was for two
years President of the Hamilton St. Andrew’s Society. From an early age
he has been a very prominent Freemason—was Grand Master of the Masonic
Grand Lodge of Canada during the years 1892 and 1893, being now the
representative of the Grand Lodge of England, and for nine years was
Sovereign Grand Commander of the Supreme Council of the Scottish Rite
Masons in Canada. He has always taken a prominent part in politics. As a
young man he was Secretary of the Hamilton Reform Association, which
position he held for many years. He was first returned to the
Legislature in 1879, representing Hamilton for a period of 19 years, and
afterwards East Wellington for 7 years. He entered the Government as
Provincial Secretary in 1889, became Commissioner of Crown Lands in
1896, and Attorney-General in 1899. He was an honorary A.D.C. to their
Excellencies, Lord Aberdeen and Lord Minto, when Governors-General, and
in 1897 was selected by the Militia Department to proceed to England in
connection with the celebration of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee; was
present by invitation, at the coronations in Westminster Abbey of the
late King Edward VII, and of the present King George V. He has always
taken a leading part at the Bar, and was made a Queen’s Counsel in 1890,
is a Bencher of the Law Society of Upper Canada, and as a young man was
an examiner in the Faculty of Law at Toronto University. In 1903 he
received the honorary degree of LL.D. from that institution, and
subsequently also from McMaster University. In 1908 he became
Lieut.-Governor of the Province of Ontario, being the last to occupy the
old Government House on King Street West, Toronto, continuing for over
six years. During his term, on the recommendation of His Royal Highness
the Duke of Connaught, then Governor-General of Canada, he was created a
Knight Commander of the Order of St. Michael and St. George. As a public
man he shrank from prominence in the public eye; he was most industrious
and faithful in the performance of any duties he undertook to discharge.
He had an excellent training for many years under the greatest of law
makers this country has ever produced, Sir Oliver Mowat. While a private
member of the Legislative Assembly he was selected as Chairman of the
Private Bills Committee, which for fifteen years he presided over with
eminent ability, fairness and impartiality. During the short period when
the license branch was under his control some of the most advanced
measures of temperance legislation were introduced by him, including the
local option law, the validity of which was stoutly contested, but in
the end affirmed by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. Though
not himself a practical sportsman, almost immediately after entering the
legislature he led a movement for better protection of game birds and
fur-bearing animals, first securing the abolition of spring shooting and
other improvements in the law, and afterwards the appointment of a Royal
Commission followed by a thorough revision of the game laws and the
establishment of a departmental branch, with a chief game warden and
other provincial wardens entrusted with the enforcement of the laws
relating to game protection. While Provincial Secretary he was always an
industrious legislator. The laws relating to Joint Stock Companies were
thoroughly revised, modernized, and simplified by him. The old laws
relating to building societies and loan companies were completely
overhauled, and became the present Loan Corporations Act. It was at this
time also that he undertook to stem the tide or flood of benefit
societies, many of them of the fake order, which threatened to inundate
this Province—a subject of legislation requiring at the time very
cautious and skilful handling, but which, with the able assistance of
Mr. J. H. Hunter, M.A., was ultimately put on a very satisfactory
footing. One of the most important laws of comparatively recent years
owes to him its existence, and has generally been referred to as the
“Gibson Act”—the Act relating to neglected and dependent children—and
the establishment of the Children’s Branch, with Mr. Kelso as its chief
officer. This law has been most beneficial in its operation, and has
been followed more or less closely in most of the other Provinces.
During his comparatively short incumbency as Commissioner of Crown Lands
he introduced and carried through the House the important legislation
prohibiting the exportation of saw logs—a measure affecting very large
interests but meeting the entire approval of the public. He also dealt
with important changes in the mining laws during a period of great
mining excitement in the Province. It is probably not generally known
that while Commissioner of Crown Lands he introduced a short but very
important measure preventing any absolute alienation by the Crown of
Provincial water powers, and providing for leasing same for short
renewable terms of years subject to conditions in the public interest.
It is somewhat singular that a public man who has often been unfairly
criticized as a champion of monopolies should never have been credited
with this act directly aimed against and prohibitive of monopoly. In the
matter of forest preservation or reforesting, Mr. Gibson aimed at
carrying out a programme which probably time would justify as the most
effective and productive policy possible. He aimed at the selection and
setting apart every year a portion of the Crown domain unfit for
agricultural purposes as a timber growing reserve. Many such sections in
Northern Ontario, which have been cut over or burnt over, and now more
or less covered over by new growth, could be set apart and treated as
territory to be guarded as timber growing areas. In the Eastern part of
the Province certain old limits were repurchased from the license
holders and so set apart, and again another area in Western Ontario. The
plan of year after year reserving areas in this way would in a
generation or so result in well defined sections of the Province
producing a new crop of timber which would not fail to become an
extremely valuable asset to posterity. It was in Sir John Gibson’s time
that the first steps were taken for the establishment of the Temagami
Reserve very effectively carried out by Mr. Davis, his successor. As
Attorney-General he had, of course, the responsibility of legislation
generally. The assessment laws had been the subject of investigation and
report at the hands of two Royal Commissioners, and amid the distressing
conflict of opinion on the various questions which arise whenever this
subject is touched, the difficulty of framing a generally acceptable
measure seemed insuperable. Whatever may be thought of the present act,
Sir John Gibson’s tact as a legislator was mainly instrumental in having
it passed through the House, and probably as time has passed and the
public have become more and more familiar with its provisions it may be
considered to give general satisfaction. The collection and revision of
Imperial Statutes in force in this Province in the shape of a brief
third volume of the Revised Statutes carried out with the aid of a
committee of the judges has been a boon to law students, and a great
convenience to the legal profession. (The foregoing facts and
observations regarding Sir John’s career have been contributed by Mr.
James Innes Macintosh, who was for several years his private secretary
when a Minister of the Crown.) He was one of the pioneers, along with
the late John Patterson and the late John Moodie, in introducing
Hydro-Electric power and long distance transmission of same in this
country utilizing surplus water from the Welland Canal, and transmitting
the power to Hamilton, where very soon many of the industrial and
electric railways adopted the same, to the great advantage of the
companies. For many years he was President of the Cataract Power
Company. He is a Director of the Canadian Bank of Commerce, the Canada
Life Assurance Company, the Toronto General Trusts Corporation, the
Toronto Conservatory of Music, the Homewood Retreat at Guelph, the
Dominion Power and Transmission Company, the Canadian Westinghouse
Company, and several other industrial companies in Hamilton. He was
married first in 1869 to Emily Annie, daughter of the late Rolph
Birrell, of London, who died in 1874; second, in 1876 to Caroline,
daughter of the late Senator Adam Hope, who died in 1877; and third, on
May 18, 1881, to Elizabeth, daughter of the late Judge Malloch, of
Brockville. He had six children, viz., John Gordon Gibson, who died
shortly after taking his B.A. degree at the University of Toronto;
Eugenia Elizabeth Emily; Margaret Mary Stewart, wife of Robert S.
Waldie, of Toronto; Archibald Hope Gibson, Barrister; Captain Colin W.
G. Gibson, of the Royal Fusiliers, who was twice severely wounded; and
Francis Malloch Gibson, who went to the front as an officer of the 48th
Highlanders at the commencement of the war and was killed in action near
Armentieres. Sir John’s manner is dignified but affable, his style of
speech clear and precise; in his movements he is deliberate, but with
the elasticity of well-preserved middle age, while his expression is
kindly but alert, with evidence of unlimited determination and
unmistakable inclination and power to lead. When an active officer of
the Militia he was recognized by his fellow-officers as a master of
field manœuvres. The beautiful family residence, “Ravenscliffe,” is
delightfully situated on the lower slope of the mountain, looking down
Ravenscliffe Avenue, through a vista of stately elm trees.

=Mitchell, The Hon. Walter George= (Quebec City), Treasurer of the
Province of Quebec, was born at Danby, in the County of Drummond. He is
the son of the Hon. Senator William Mitchell, his mother’s maiden name
being Miss Dora Goddard. His early education was matured at the Montreal
High School and at the Bishop’s College school of Lennoxville.
Thereafter he entered McGill University as an undergraduate, finally
taking his degree of B.C.L. in 1901. On being admitted to practice at
the Bar, he became connected with the law firm of Greenshields,
Greenshields & Heneker. Two years after he became a prominent member of
the firm of Laflamme, Mitchell and Callaghan, receiving his K.C. in
1912. In view of his being chosen by the Lieutenant-Governor to assume
the duties of the Hon. P. S. G. Mackenzie, who had died suddenly, he was
subsequently elected by acclamation as representative of the
constituency of Richmond, a county which he continues to represent as
Member of the Provincial Parliament, after a second election by
acclamation. Prior to his assuming the office of Provincial Treasurer,
Mr. Mitchell was in possession of a large and lucrative practice in
Montreal. While actively engaged with his professional duties, as a
leading lawyer, he did not fail to take an active interest in political
affairs, and came into public prominence in the administration of the
Montreal Reform Club. Through his efforts in co-operation with his
associate members, new and attractive quarters for that club were
erected on Sherbrooke Street; and, in 1913, he was chosen, by way of
reward for his active services, the President of that flourishing
institution, and in the following year was re-elected to the same
office. From the date of the famous Drummond-Arthabaska election contest
in 1910, Mr. Mitchell became more and more intimately identified with
the political life of the Eastern Townships and its various electoral
movements. During the winning of the constituency of Drummond-Arthabaska
back to the Liberal interest in 1910, he was associated with Dr. Beland,
later a prisoner of war in Germany, and was acclaimed everywhere as an
eloquent and persuasive pleader in behalf of the naval policy of Sir
Wilfrid Laurier. In fact, in 1911, it was to a large extent through Mr.
Mitchell’s influence as an organizer, not to speak of his father’s
unbroken popularity as a public man, and other influences, that the
constituency of Drummond-Arthabaska was won over to the Liberal
interest. As Provincial Treasurer, Mr. Mitchell has made a name for
himself as a most successful financier, taking a prominent rank almost
immediately as a parliamentary debater. Nor has he failed to share in
remedial legislation, whenever such came up for consideration in the
Provincial Parliament. He has interested himself particularly in
modifying the Quebec License Law, fathering amendments to that law
restricting the number of licenses, increasing the license fees,
prohibiting treating, increasing the age limit, shortening the hours of
sale, and urging an enactment to abolish the bars on the 1st of May,
1918, with immediate sanction to the Minister of Militia and Defence to
declare any or all districts throughout the Province of Quebec “out of
bounds” for soldiers and sailors. At his instance also the Quebec
Insurance Act has been amended from time to time, so as to give better
protection to the public. One of his most notable and highly patriotic
acts in parliament since the war in Europe began, was his presentation
of a Bill, asking authority to subscribe out of the public revenues in
behalf of his native province a million of dollars to the Canadian
Patriotic Fund—a proposal which met with an instant and unanimous
approval from both chambers. Under his mature financial advice the
Province of Quebec has spent millions of dollars in constructing and
improving highways of nearly every district. And yet so prudently have
the finances of the province been husbanded under his judicious
oversight, that the provincial debt has virtually remained as easy a
burden on the people as it ever has been, notwithstanding the large
amounts spent on the highways, and the large increase in the grants to
education, agriculture, and public works. Altogether Mr. Mitchell has
won the highest credit as a parliamentarian and a financier, enjoying
the full confidence of his colleagues and of many of his fellow
legislators, irrespective of party lines. He was married on February the
4th, 1907, Mrs. Mitchell’s maiden name having been Miss Antonia
Pelletier. Their family comprises two sons and three daughters.

=Parsons, S. R.= (Toronto, Ont.), President of the British-American Oil
Co., Ltd., Oil Refineries, was born in Port Hope, Ont., in 1854. Son of
William and Margaret (Trick) Parsons. He received his education in the
Public and Grammar Schools of that town and began business with the firm
of James Campbell & Son, at that time extensive manufacturing
stationers, and publishers of Toronto. After six years’ association with
this firm he removed to Winnipeg and subsequently engaged in the
wholesale stationery business as senior partner in Parsons, Bell & Co.,
which afterwards merged with the Consolidated Stationery Co., Ltd., of
which he was President for a number of years. In 1882 Mr. Parsons
married Anne Kate Helliwell, daughter of Rev. Thomas Lord Helliwell of
Winnipeg, and has three daughters, Mrs. Chas. A. Withers, Mrs. Henry F.
Gooderham, and Mrs. Errol A. Hethrington, all of Toronto. After sixteen
years of successful business in Winnipeg, Mr. Parsons was compelled to
leave the northern climate in the interest of his health and returned to
Toronto where in 1906, along with others, he established the extensive
business of which he continues the moving spirit. He has always taken an
active interest in religious, social and philanthropic work and for many
years has been a director of the Methodist Union. Since 1900 he has been
Chairman of the Ontario Board of Directors, Canadian Fire Insurance Co.,
and is a member of the Northern Ontario Fire Relief Committee, and the
Organization of Resources Committee of the Province of Ontario, also of
the Ontario Executive of the Bonne Entente at whose meeting in the
Chateau Frontenac, Quebec, in 1916, he was one of the principal speakers
and put forward this three-plank platform: First—We ought to live
together in sincerity, friendship and justice; Second—We ought to
strive for a cleaner public life; Third—We ought to help maintain the
integrity and strength of our great Empire. But it is in connection with
his work in the Canadian Manufacturers Association that Mr. Parsons has
come most prominently before the public, for though naturally being far
from an aggressive man, when the burden of office was laid upon him he
realized his responsibilities to the full and has frequently from the
platform, in the press and in action given evidence of the reserve force
that was in him. He was elected for four successive years (1911-1915)
Chairman of the Transportation Committee of the Association; Second
Vice-President in 1915, First Vice-President in 1916, and President at
the Annual Meeting of the Association in Winnipeg in 1917. He was
Chairman in 1917 of the Committee of Employers of Labor for the Province
of Ontario to secure men to help in the harvest fields, an organization
responsible for the saving of many millions in food stuffs. On assuming
office as President of the C.M.A. Mr. Parsons delivered an inspiring
inaugural address of a thoroughly business character, but progressive,
loyal, ethical, liberal and humanitarian as well. In 1918 he was
appointed a representative of the C.M.A. on the Federal Board for the
settlement of Labor disputes. Writing of him on this occasion, “The
Monetary Times” says: “He is a capable, energetic business man, with a
frank and alert manner that wins confidence. The welfare of the Canadian
Manufacturers Association is in good hands under his care. He is a type
of Association President well able to smooth out many of the
difficulties between capital and labor, having appreciation of the
problems met by both.” Mr. William Lewis Edmonds writes at the same time
in “Industrial Canada”: “While Mr. Parsons is strong as a business man,
and particularly in the quality of executive ability, that is not the
only direction in which his strength lies. He is a strong man all the
way round. He is a man of strong opinions and particularly on subjects
that approach the ethical in character, and having cultivated the habit
of looking at controversial subjects from the other fellow’s perspective
as well as his own, it is not a difficult thing to persuade him to
change his attitude, provided the other fellow is right and he is wrong,
but when once after carefully weighing the pros and cons, he is
persuaded that he is right he’ll not surrender principles, although
where non-essentials are the issue he will readily agree to a
compromise. In judgment he is sound, and in insight keen and quick.
Although not connected with either political party, Mr. Parsons takes a
keen interest in public affairs, and practical movements which have for
their object a betterment of conditions in state and society have his
warm, and in many instances, his active sympathy.” Writing in the
“Toronto Star Weekly,” Arthur Hawkes says: “Mr. Parson’s service in the
Manufacturers Association has been real service, and not a still hunt
for glory. In committee he is as cautious as strong, and as strong as
wise. He looks often before he leaps and he can take a pretty good
leap—the fundamental condition of which is that he shall have examined
the jumping-off place and surveyed the spot where he intends to land.
When he has made up his mind he doesn’t change it, which is because he
is sound in judgment.” In concluding his quite lengthy sketch and
referring particularly to Mr. Parsons’ political platform he says: “This
is a pretty good creed. It is just like Parsons. If you know him you
know an honest manufacturer, a broad Methodist, and a friend who is with
you till daylight.” Of him, “Motoring” says: “He presented an excellent
report to the C.M.A. convention as Chairman of the Special Committee on
the Co-ordination of recruiting and production. He is a clear thinker
and speaker and could probably quote from half a hundred authors. He is
a keen business man and one who puts his best efforts into all he
undertakes.” Mr. Parsons is not only a clear thinker but an apt phraser
as may be judged from this clause in his inaugural address as President
of the C.M.A.: “These are surely days for plain living and high
thinking, days when there is a compression of life, and days which
summon all that is heroic within us to stand like men in meeting our
duties, whether they be personal, social, local or national.” In a
speech before the Canadian Club of Orillia, in February, 1918, on
“War-Time Business and Profits” which was endorsed by the C.M.A.
Executive and published in the principal papers of Canada, Mr. Parsons
said: “Canadians, let us know each other better, let us understand and
sympathize with each other’s problems, for in that knowledge lies
increased production, good feeling between city and country, prosperity
in reason and fair play to all.” A strong desire for fair play and
justice to all is the outstanding characteristic of Mr. Parsons’ whole
attitude towards any question, and, while conservatively progressive he
is so liberally and humanely so that his influence in the important
association of which he is President cannot fail to be productive of
better feeling between employer and employees. In manner Mr. Parsons is
genial and easy of approach, a good conversationalist, well-read and
with a ready and apt style of expression, but views every question
apparently through ethical spectacles—a habit unfortunately not
generally in vogue. He is a member of the National Club, Canadian Club,
and Toronto Board of Trade. He is a Unionist in politics, and a member
of the Methodist Church. His office is the 13th floor of the Royal Bank
Building and his residence 139 Crescent Road, Toronto.

=Forman, James C.= (Toronto, Ont.), Assessment Commissioner, a son of
the late James Forman, one of the 93rd Highlanders, was born November
23, 1851, and received his education in the Public and Model Schools and
British-American Commercial College. He occupied a position in a
broker’s and insurance office for about two years, and then entered the
employ of the wholesale dry goods firm of Dobbie and Carrie, remaining
there for over four years. Mr. Forman, afterwards, while in the employ
of the late George Warin, was offered a temporary position in the City
Hall by the late Stephen Radcliff, City Clerk. He was permanently
appointed in 1878 as Assessment Clerk, and gradually worked his way up
the ladder until he assumed his present position in 1905, succeeding Mr.
R. J. Fleming on the latter’s resignation. Mr. Forman has taken a close
interest in assessment matters, having read papers before the Ontario
Municipal Association and International Tax Association and is
frequently selected to represent the City Council at their meetings. In
1903 he was in close touch with former Attorney-General Sir John Gibson
in the preparing of the new Assessment Act. In October, 1908, he read a
paper before the Internation Tax Association on “Business Assessments as
a Substitute for Personal Property.” He takes the deepest interest in
town planning and represented the City Council at Philadelphia, May,
1911, and the Board of Trade at Boston, reading a short paper at the
latter city in May, 1912. He has prepared a report on the Single Tax
Situation as he found it in the West, from Winnipeg to Victoria. Mr.
Forman is in every respect a man who has done his share toward placing
Toronto on its present high pinnacle of fame, and has won the esteem of
all citizens by his safe and able administration of the office of
Assessment Commissioner. He is a man of undoubted integrity, with keen
instinct and a pleasing countenance. He is a warm adherent, an active
worker and for several years occupant of the post of “People’s Warden”
of St. Matthew’s Church, First Avenue. He has refused several flattering
offers from the leading real estate concerns of this city, preferring to
remain in his present position.

=Shortly, Orville Benjamin=, began his career with the Metropolitan Life
Insurance Company on July 6, 1903. In 1904 he was appointed
Superintendent of the Ottawa district. Arriving in Ottawa he immediately
entered upon his duties in that capacity. It was not long before he had
secured for his company a large number of policy-holders who, as the
days, months and years passed by, grew larger and larger in numbers
until, up to 1918, his large and greatly increased staff of employees at
the head office, The Metropolitan Life Building, corner Metcalfe and
Queen Streets, Ottawa, and his numerous agents, are kept busily and
industriously employed. Previous to his arrival in Ottawa the
Metropolitan Life Insurance Company had failed to make itself well
established. His advent in the Capital of Canada, however, changed all
this and activity and progress began and has been in operation ever
since. As a recognition of the value of his services, in March, 1918,
the General Management of The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company
promoted him to the Chief Agency for the whole of Canada—a
well-deserved and well-earned promotion, while he still retained the
Superintendency of the Ottawa district, which up to the date of his
promotion controlled no less than forty-three thousand policyholders. On
October 28, 1918, Mr. Shortly was again promoted by his company, having
been transferred from Ottawa to take charge of the Toronto district of
the Metropolitan Life. He resides at 15 Whitney Ave., North Rosedale,
and his office address is 4 Richmond St. East. Although Mr. Shortly only
came to reside in Toronto on October 28, 1918, he has already been
placed on the executive of the Life Underwriters’ Association of
Toronto; has been made a member of the Association of Life Managers, and
been elected to membership in the Ontario Club, the Royal Canadian Yacht
Club, the Canadian Club, and the Scarborough Golf Club. Mr. Shortly is
the author of several essays on Life Insurance Salesmanship, and has
given addresses before several Life Insurance associations. He is a past
President of the Life Underwriters’ Association of Ottawa. He is an
enthusiastic sportsman. In his earlier days, when he was quite an
athlete, he was an expert bicyclist and captured many first prizes in
racing contests. When, in 1914, the terrible war hostilities commenced,
Mr. Shortly placed his services, such as he could give, at the services
of the State and forced his way into the midst of the greatest war
activities in the City of Ottawa. In collecting funds for the several
patriotic objects, and in helping to make the Victory Loans successful
he was one of the most active and his services were of inestimable
value. Prior to engaging in the insurance business Mr. Shortly was
salesman and manager for Eastern Ontario for the Canadian Typograph
Company of Windsor, Ontario. He has travelled considerably throughout
the continent and Europe. On August 27, 1917, Governor Whitman, Governor
of New York State, appointed Mr. Shortly Commissioner of Deeds for the
State of New York. Mr. Shortly was born in Peterborough, Ontario,
Canada, August 13, 1875, and was educated in the Peterborough Public
Schools. He is the son of Benjamin and Hattie Robertson Shortly. His
father is a merchant in Peterborough and holds the distinction of being
in business there longer than any other man. A prominent relative is
James E. Kavanagh, 3rd Vice-President of the Metropolitan Life Insurance
Company. On September 28, 1904, Mr. Shortly married Mabel Louise Howe,
daughter of Etna D. Howe, 24 Whitney Avenue, Toronto, President Northrop
& Lyman Drug Company. Two children have blessed the union—Orville Dean,
born August 3, 1905, and John Benjamin, born February 24, 1910. He is a
member of the Laurentian, Canadian, the Rivermead Golf, and the Wright
Fish and Game Clubs, of the Board of Trade, the Y.M.C.A., Masonic Order,
Scottish Rite, Murphy Chapter Rose Croix. For recreation he enjoys golf,
fishing and hunting.

=Cotton, Major-General W. H.= (Toronto, Ont.), commanding 2nd Division

=Marchand, Pierre= (Ottawa), Controller of Expenditure, Department of
Interior, when appointed to a position by Sir Clifford Sifton, who was
then Minister of the Interior, took office as an accountant whose
talents and ability as such had been well tested and approved on several
previous occasions. As accountant in the offices of the Lake
Temiscamingue Colonization Railway at Mattawa, Ontario; in his occupancy
of a similar position with Leblanc & Lemay, wholesale and retail
clothiers and gent’s furnishers, and afterwards with D. V. Ranger,
wholesale merchant at Ottawa, he was always found quick and reliable in
his work, and, besides gaining and retaining the full confidence of his
employers, he firmly established himself as an accountant of enviable
reputation. It was in 1899, owing to the increased and rapidly
increasing work that the Department of Interior was called upon to
handle, attributable to Sir Clifford Sifton’s able and progressive
administration, that Mr. Marchand’s services were secured, and the
expenditure branch of that Department required carefulness, watchfulness
and efficiency, and had to be placed in charge of one whose past record
had stamped on it faithfulness and reliability. Since Mr. Marchand’s
advent into that part of the Civil Service, the expenditure of the
Department of Interior has had a painstaking, reliable and efficient
public official, and one whose ever-attentive industry and care has
elevated it to a high standard of excellent management. Prior to
entering the Civil Service, Mr. Marchand was an active political worker
in the Liberal party’s interests in Ottawa. At one time, and for several
years, he was Secretary for the Club National, a French-Canadian Liberal
organization, and was recognized as a strong and effective political
worker. The late Hon. F. G. Marchand, who became Premier of Quebec, was
one of Mr. Marchand’s many prominent relatives. Mr. Marchand was born at
Ottawa, December 25, 1866, and is the son of Amable Marchand and Adelina
Belair. His father was a prominent accountant, who saw that his son
received a good commercial and classical education in Ottawa, Montreal
and Quebec. Mr. Marchand was twice married. On October 6, 1891, he
married at Ottawa, Josephine, daughter of Mrs. O. Lafleur, a widow. She
died in May, 1916. On January 10th, 1917, he married in Ottawa, Bertha,
daughter of P. Girard, whose residence is at Carillon, Quebec. By this
second marriage, his home is blessed with a son and a daughter, Rosaire
and Carmen. Mr. Marchand is a member of the Institut Canadien-Français
and Monument National. In religion he is a Roman Catholic, and he
resides at 81 Stewart Street.

=Northrup, William Barton, K.C., M.A.= (Ottawa, Ont.), Clerk of the
House of Commons, is an eminent lawyer, and was for many years head of
the legal firm of Northrup and Roberts, of Belleville, Ontario. For many
years he sat in the House as the representative for East Hastings,
Ontario, and was noted for his able debates and the eloquent and
persistent manner in which he advocated the establishment of divorce
tribunals where the poor as well as the rich would be accorded fair play
and justice, and the abolition of the costly Senate procedure, which was
antiquated, unjust and farcical and unreliable. Mr. Northrup was first
elected to Parliament at a by-election to fill the vacancy caused by the
death of Mr. S. B. Burdell, who was returned to Parliament at the
general election in 1891. He was unsuccessful in his candidature in the
general election in 1896, but at the general elections of 1900-4-8 and
1911 he was successful. He did not run in the war election in 1917. In
1902 he accompanied the Rt. Hon. Sir R. L. Borden on the North-West
tour. Succeeding Dr. T. B. Flint, M.A., LL.B., D.C.L., he was appointed
Clerk of the House of Commons in 1918. Like the late Dr. Flint, Mr. W.
B. Northrup has had a long experience as a member of the House of
Commons, and is an expert in parliamentary practice. His natural
geniality and uniform courtesy made him friends on both sides of the
House. With distinguished ability, grace and dignity he fills the
position of Clerk of the House of Commons. William Barton Northrup is
the son of the late A. G. N. Northrup, Deputy-Clerk of the Crown and
Pleas, County Hastings, Ontario. He was born in Belleville, Ontario,
October 19, 1856, and was educated at the Belleville Grammar School,
Upper Canada College, and Toronto University (B.A. with honors 1877,
M.A. 1878). June 1, 1879, he married Minnie, eldest daughter of the late
J. E. Procter, Brighton, Ontario. She died June, 1905. In June, 1907, he
married Mary Schryver, daughter of the late J. C. Fitch, Toronto, and
relict of F. C. Clemow. He was created K.C. in 1902, bencher Law
Society, 1906, and was re-elected. In the House of Commons in 1892 he
moved the address in reply to the Speech from the Throne, and in 1906
seconded the address inviting King Edward and Queen Alexandra to visit
Canada. In his youth he was a noted cricketer.

=Braden, Norman Short= (Hamilton, Ont.), is an electrical engineer by
profession and one of the industrial chieftains of that city. He was
born at Indianapolis, U.S.A., on June 15, 1869, the son of James Braden,
a physician, and Lydia E. Braden. The Braden family are of Scottish
descent, and his ancestors emigrated from the North of Ireland to the
United States in the eighteenth century. Mr. Braden was educated at the

Limited, of Hamilton, Ont., in 1903, he moved to the latter city, and
was appointed manager of the sales department, in charge of the
commercial electrical development and activities of his Company for the
entire Dominion. Under his direction the growth of the Canadian
Westinghouse Company’s business has expanded with great rapidity,
requiring an increase of capital from $1,500,000 in 1903 to $10,000,000
in 1918. It gives employment to upwards of three thousand hands, and is
the largest manufacturer of electrical apparatus in Canada. In 1919, Mr.
Braden was elected third vice-president of the company with executive
charge of its commercial organization. The subject of this sketch is
also identified with another of Hamilton’s leading industries, the B.
Greening Wire Co., Ltd. On November 29, 1906, he married Mabel, daughter
of Samuel Owen and Jennie H. Greening. The Greening family have been
prominent manufacturers of wire products in England since the year

Bowie was recalled from overseas, and, March, 1918, was appointed as
Sergeant-at-Arms. Shortly after the Great War was declared Colonel Bowie
made every effort to follow those who had already gone overseas, or to
join those who were preparing to go, but, owing to official and other
duties over which he had to preside he was unable to leave until 1916,
when he went as second major of the 77th Overseas Battalion. In August,
1916, he became attached to the 60th Battalion in France, but was
shortly afterwards, October, 1916, called from France to Bramshott,
England, to command a Provisional Battalion, C.E.F. It was at this time,
October, 1916, that Colonel Bowie’s eldest son, Lieut. Guy Gouin Bowie,
left Canada for overseas with the 154th Infantry Battalion, C.E.F.
Colonel Bowie remained in command of the Provisional Battalion until

1918. In the meantime his son, Lieut. Guy Gouin Bowie, who was born in
Ottawa, October 10, 1892, followed in his father’s footsteps and had
quite an eventful military career. He was appointed to the Active
Militia, G.G.F.G., as Lieutenant on December 15, 1915, and received his

=Murray, Hon. Robert, K.C.=, Provincial Secretary-Treasurer of the
Province of New Brunswick, is one of the best known and widely respected
public men of the Maritime Provinces. He was born at Chatham, N.B.,
where he still resides, on July 17, 1855, the son of Robert and Jane
Murray. His father was a millwright, and the younger Robert was educated
at the Presbyterian Academy in his native town, from which he graduated
in 1871. At school he had shown himself to be of a naturally studious
turn of mind, and decided to qualify himself for the bar. He was Police
Magistrate for the town of Chatham, N.B., from 1887 to 1891, when he
resigned. For upwards of forty years he followed his profession as a
barrister in the town of Chatham, and has built up a large practice in
the County of Northumberland, where he is held in general esteem and
confidence. Subsequently, in 1902, his standing was recognized when he
was created a King’s Counsel. In addition, he devoted himself to public
and municipal affairs, and was identified with the Liberal party. His
first public service was as a member of the County Council of
Northumberland, and he was later an alderman of the town of Chatham. In
1905 he was elected by acclamation in a by-election as one of the
representatives of Northumberland County in the Provincial Legislature,
where he served till 1908. During the past few years, there have been
several political upheavals in the province of New Brunswick, and in
1917, when the Conservative ministry, headed by Hon. G. Clarke, sought
the franchise of the people, there was a demand for new men. In that
contest, Mr. Murray was induced to stand as one of the Liberal
candidates for Northumberland, which sends four members to the
Legislature. He was elected, and at the same time the Murray
administration, of which Hon. J. A. Murray was Premier, was defeated.
Hon. Walter E. Foster, who was called upon to form a ministry, at once
sent for Mr. Murray and offered him the portfolio of Provincial
Secretary-Treasurer, in succession to Hon. D. V. Landry. The offer was
accepted, and Mr. Murray has since conducted the finances of the
province to the satisfaction of everyone. From his youth Mr. Murray took
an active interest in the militia of his district, and retired in 1910
with the rank of Major, receiving the long service decoration. During
the late war he played an energetic, useful part in promoting Canada’s
military and patriotic effort. In religion he is a Presbyterian, and is
a member of the A.F. & A.M., and the I.O.O.F. His recreations are
hunting, curling and quoit playing. On June 11, 1889, he married Jane,
daughter of Simon F. Simpson, of Negnac, Northumberland County, N.B.,
and has three children, Nina Helen, Vera Alice, and Robert Blaine, all
of whom are now married. Though his public duties compel him to spend
much of his time in Fredericton, his home is still at Chatham, N.B., and
he continues the practice of his profession there.

=Weld, John=, publisher (London, Ont.), was born on a farm in Middlesex
County, Ont., on September 7, 1854. His father, the late William Weld,
son of an Anglican Church clergyman, emigrated from Tenterden, Kent,
England, in 1843, and made a home for himself amid the forests of
Delaware Township. After living the life of a pioneer farmer for twenty
years, he founded “The Farmer’s Advocate” of London in 1866 as a means
of assisting other settlers who were continually coming to him for
advice, and it is through his long association with this journal and its
colleague, “The Farmer’s Advocate and Home Journal” of Winnipeg that the
subject of this sketch became so widely known. After receiving his early
education in the London schools, Mr. Weld learned the printing business
in a local shop and completed his apprenticeship with a short
post-graduate engagement with a large New York publishing house.
Returning to Canada, he was attracted by the West, which was then
opening up for settlers, and he staked his claim in Saskatchewan, where
he “proved up” on a half-section in 1885. The growth of “The Farmer’s
Advocate” then necessitated his return to London, where he became
business manager of the publication until his father’s death on January
3, 1891. He then became general manager, and when the Wm. Weld Company,
Ltd., was organized and incorporated in July of the same year, he
acquired a controlling interest in the firm, which he has since held.
The first issue of “The Farmer’s Advocate” of Winnipeg appeared in 1890.
It was edited in the West, but a separate company was not organized
until July 31, 1905, when The Farmer’s Advocate of Winnipeg, Ltd., was
incorporated with Mr. Weld as President. A building was erected on
Princess Street in that year, but it proved inadequate to meet the
ever-growing requirements of the business, so it was sold in 1911, and a
five-story concrete, fire-proof building was constructed at the corner
of Notre Dame and Langside Streets. In order to keep the two
publications inseparably linked with practical and progressive farming,
as well as to provide means whereby the editors might keep constantly in
touch with varying agricultural conditions, a farm was purchased in the
neighbourhood of London, and, incidentally, a separated portion of this
is a part of the Weld homestead which has always been owned by the
family under the original Crown grant. The subject of this sketch spends
many enjoyable hours on Weldwood Farm, where pure-bred Yorkshire swine
and one of the largest herds of pure-bred dual-purpose Shorthorns in
Canada are maintained. The Bryant Press, Toronto, of which Mr. Weld is
President, was acquired in 1903, and he is also President of the London
Printing and Lithographing Company, Ltd. He has held various offices in
the Canadian Press Association, and was the only representative of the
Agricultural Press to visit Britain and the war zone in company with
Canadian publishers and editors, the party being the guests of the
Imperial Government in the summer of 1918. He is a member of the
Anglican Church, and a life member of the Masonic Order, Tuscan Lodge
195, A.F. & A.M.

=Foster, Hon. Walter Edward=, Premier of New Brunswick, is also one of
the most prominent business men of that Province. He was born at St.
Martins, N.B., on April 9, 1874, the son of Edward H. and Elizabeth
(Pattison) Foster, and educated at the public and grammar schools of St.
John, N.B. As a boy of fifteen he entered the Bank of New Brunswick as a
junior clerk, and remained in its service until 1899, when he became a
member of the firm of Vassie & Co., Ltd., wholesale dry goods merchants,
St. John. Of this firm he is now Vice-President and Managing Director.
He is also actively connected with transportation and shipping
interests, and is President of the St. Martins Railway Co. He was
Vice-President of the St. John Board of Trade in 1906-7, and President
in 1908-9. He was Third Arbitrator and Chairman of the Conciliation
Board which successfully settled differences between the longshoremen of
the Port of St. John and the Shipping Federation, 1913. In the autumn of
1915 differences having again arisen between the Longshoremen’s
Association and the shipping companies at St. John, he was appointed
Chairman of the Conciliation Board by the Minister of Labor of Canada,
and succeeded in effecting an agreement for two years. Coming as it did
in the midst of the war, this settlement was of the highest importance
in a military sense. Hon. Mr. Foster was formerly an officer in the New
Brunswick Regiment, Canadian Artillery, retiring with the rank of
Captain in 1903. He has been for a good many years identified with the
Liberal party, and is a Past President of the Young Liberals Club of St.
John, but not until comparatively recently did he become a candidate for
political office. In 1916 the Liberal party in the Legislature decided
on reorganization, and offered the leadership of the Opposition to Mr.
Foster. He accepted, and at once threw himself with energy into the task
of putting the party on a fighting basis. At the general elections of
February 24, 1917, he was victorious at the polls, and he was shortly
afterward sworn in as First Minister. His business-like and economical
administration in a difficult period has given satisfaction to all
classes of citizens. He is a member of the Union Club, St. John, and was
President of the Cliff Club, 1915-7. In religion he is an Anglican. On
January 18, 1900, he married Jehan Mary, daughter of William Vassie, St.

=Charlesworth, Hector=, journalist (Toronto, Ont.), was born at
Hamilton, Ont., September 28, 1872, the son of Horatio G. and Charlotte
(McEachern) Charlesworth. He is a Canadian of several generations, some
of his forbears having come to Quebec after the British conquest in the
eighteenth century. His maternal grandfather, John McEachern, whose
parents went to Manitoba with Lord Selkirk’s party, was born at Fort
Garry on the site of the present city of Winnipeg, in 1811. When he was
but very young, his parents travelled in canoes through the waterways of
Northern Ontario to Montreal, and later made their home at Chateauguay
Basin, Que. Mr. Charlesworth has lived in Toronto since 1876, and was
educated at Wellesley School and Jarvis Street Collegiate Institute. His
father was a shoe manufacturer; and in 1887 he was articled as a
chartered accountant with a view to his ultimately becoming office
manager of the firm. At seventeen he commenced writing anonymously under
the _nom de plume_ of “Touchstone” for Toronto “Saturday Night.” In 1891
Mr. E. E. Shepherd, editor of the journal, inserted an advertisement
asking the contributor to disclose his identity, and on learning it
offered him a position on the staff of that journal. He remained with
Mr. Shepherd for a year, and then resolved to qualify himself by
practical experience as a reporter. During the next eighteen years he
worked on several daily newspapers, including “The World,” “The News,”
and “The Mail and Empire,” of which latter journal he was City Editor
from 1904 to 1910. Shortly after the reorganization of “Saturday Night”
as a national weekly he was offered and accepted the post of Assistant
Managing Editor, which he still holds. Though he has been a copious
writer on political, financial and social topics, he is perhaps best
known as a musical and dramatic critic. He acted as Chairman of the
Board of Judges at the Earl Grey dramatic competitions, Toronto, 1911,
and of Winnipeg, 1912, and eliminating judge in the Duke of Connaught’s
competition, 1913. He was also chief judge in the “Collier’s Weekly”
competition to secure suitable English words for “O Canada” in 1909. He
has written essays and sketches for many publications, including the
“International Studio,” the “New York Evening Post,” “Christian Science
Monitor,” “New York Times,” the “Canadian Bankers’ Journal,” and the
“Canadian Magazine.” His name appears among the contributors to volume
one, number one, of the latter publication. He was one of the special
writers engaged in connection with the Victory Loan Campaigns of 1918
and 1919, his work being syndicated throughout Canada, and has edited
and contributed to many Canadian books of reference. His other published
work includes a treatise on modern methods of treating tuberculosis
published by the National Sanitarium Association, and the narrative
introduction to Dr. Herbert A. Bruce’s controversial book “Politics and
the Canadian Army Medical Service.” In 1900 he was personally thanked by
the family of the late Robert Louis Stevenson for two sonnets protesting
against a movement to remove the remains of that author from Samoa,
which have since been reprinted in the “Oxford Book of Canadian Verse.”
He was also one of nine accredited Canadian correspondents who
accompanied the present King and Queen (then Duke and Duchess of
Cornwall and York) on the Royal tour of 1901, and later reported His
Majesty’s visit to the Quebec Tercentenary in 1908. On February 15,
1897, he married Katherine, second daughter of Peter Ryan, Toronto, and
has two children, Constance Charlotte (born 1904) and Lionel Victor
(born 1906).

=Bennett, Richard Bedford, K.C., LL.B.= (Calgary, Alta.), is one of the
leading barristers and publicists of the Canadian West. He was born at
Hopewell, Albert County, New Brunswick, on July 3, 1870, the son of
Henry J. and Henrietta (Stiles) Bennett. His father was of U.E. Loyalist
stock, and his mother’s people settled in Canada immediately after the
British conquest of 1759-60. On both sides Mr. Bennett represents the
ninth generation born on this side of the Atlantic. He was educated in
the Public and High Schools of New Brunswick and at Dalhousie
University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, where he qualified for the law and
received the degree of LL.B. He was called to the New Brunswick Bar in
1893, and for a time practised at Chatham, N.B., as the partner of the
late Hon. L. J. Tweedie, afterward Prime Minister and
Lieutenant-Governor of the Province. In 1897 he removed to Calgary, and
was called to the Bar of the North-West Territories, forming a
partnership with Mr. (now Sir) James Lougheed, at present Government
leader in the Dominion Senate and Minister of Civil Re-establishment, a
partnership which has continued ever since. In 1907, Mr. Bennett was
created King’s Counsel. In 1898, one year after his arrival in the West,
he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of the North-West Territories
for West Calgary, and sat in that body until its dissolution in 1905, on
the granting of autonomy to Alberta and Saskatchewan. In 1909, he was
elected for his old constituency to the Alberta Legislature, and was
recognized as the ablest debater in that body. Among his public services
was the exposure of the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway transaction,
which led to a change from the Rutherford to the Sifton administration
and Cabinet reconstruction. At the Federal elections of 1911 he resigned
from the Alberta Legislature to run for the House of Commons as
Conservative candidate for Calgary. He was elected, and the same
campaign placed Sir Robert Borden in power. At Ottawa, Mr. Bennett was
at once recognized as one of the leading figures on the Government
benches, and in the trying period which followed the outbreak of the war
in 1914 proved a source of strength to the administration. Actively
identified with the Canadian Patriotic Fund and Red Cross Society.
President of the Alberta Provincial Branch of the latter, member of
Central Council and of Executive of Patriotic Fund. He accompanied Sir
Robert Borden to Great Britain and France in 1915 on the occasion of the
Prime Minister’s first visit of inspection to the Canadian army
overseas, and later became Chairman of the National Service Commission
to report on Canada’s war possibilities in men and resources. At the
general election of 1917 declined re-nomination, but supported Union
Government. In addition to his renowned forensic abilities, Mr. Bennett
has a deep grasp of commercial and development questions. Shortly after
going to the West he became identified with the irrigation projects of
the Canadian Pacific Railway Company. He resigned his position as
counsel to that company in Alberta on being elected to the House of
Commons. He is to-day interested in and director of several industrial
and financial corporations, including the Metropolitan Life Insurance
Company of New York. In religion he is a Methodist, and in politics an
Independent. He is a Bencher of the Law Society of Alberta, Fellow of
the Royal Colonial Institute, and a member of the following clubs:
Ranchmen’s and Golf and Country, Calgary; Rideau and Country, Ottawa.

=Butterworth, John George Bissett=, Ottawa’s premier coal merchant, was
born at Port Hawkesbury, Nova Scotia, in 1848. His ancestors can be
traced back to the Huguenots of France, whose lives were in constant
danger in the 16th and 17th centuries, who were constantly involved in
war, who were persecuted and suffered severely in the reign of Francis
I. and his successors, and of whom from 25,000 to 30,000 suffered death
at the massacre of St. Bartholomew, August 20, 1572. In 1685, hundreds
of thousands of these Puritans went into exile, going to Prussia,
Holland, Switzerland, England, Scotland, and America, and Mr.
Butterworth’s ancestors found a resting-place, a place of safety, in
England, where they remained and industriously added to the wealth of
the country, and took part in the Peninsular War at the beginning of the
19th century. Being seafaring, enterprising, and ambitious men, and with
a desire to make their mark in the new world, where they would have
large scope to exercise their talents, they left the old country and
arrived at Port Hawkesbury, Nova Scotia, where, eventually, they became
builders and owners of merchant ships and captains in the merchant
fleet, and married into United Empire families. Tiring of seafaring
life, and in compliance with the wishes of the sons, and at the
suggestion of the mother, Mr. Butterworth, Sr., sold out his shipping
interests and the valuable lands and wharves which he owned at Port
Hawkesbury, and with his wife and family arrived in Ottawa, which was
then in its infancy, having been incorporated just one year, previously.
When they grew up, Mr. Butterworth and his two brothers, E. B. and C. A.
Butterworth, following in the ambitious footsteps of their ancestors,
not satisfied with their then existing opportunities for advancement,
left for the United States, and engaged in business and met with
success. Their love for the British Empire, however, was still dominant
within them, and they decided to sell out, return to Canada, and make it
their future home. In 1874, they entered into business in Ottawa as
hardware merchants and metal workers, and later, in 1881, started in the
coal business. Eventually, C. A. and E. B. retired from the coal
business and continued in the hardware business, while J. G. B., the
subject of this sketch, retired from both of these and remained alone as
the coal merchant, which business he has carried on to this day most
successfully, and which to-day holds the lead of all others. Mr.
Butterworth has three plants, with large storage capacity sufficient to
hold at any one time 25,000 tons, and enabling him to constantly carry a
heavy stock of coal during the summer to provide against delays in
winter transportation and during the winter season. Over $100,000 is
invested in these plants. In the severe winter of 1917, had it not been
for the provision made by and the ability of Mr. Butterworth to supply
large quantities of coal, there would have been great hardship in not
only Ottawa, but in Carleton Place, Perth, Almonte, Arnprior, Renfrew,
and many outside places in the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, to which
points he was able to and did ship thousands of tons of coal. He, in
that terrible winter, became the great provider of the people of Ottawa
and her surrounding neighbours by supplying them with the coal they
needed. For 1918 he was equally prepared to meet any emergency that
might arise, but, luckily, the winter was not of a nature so severe as
that of the previous year. In 1917, in order to cope with all demands
that were likely to be made, Mr. Butterworth practically took care of
the coal trade. He took the whole output of the Independent Coal Mine in
Pennsylvania, shipped the small sizes to N.Y. and N.J. to the textile
and munitions factories, and the prepared sizes into Canada. In so doing
he secured large quantities of coal which otherwise could not have been
obtained, and his foresight and enterprise prevented a serious coal
famine in Ottawa and the other places before mentioned. The name of John
George Bissett Butterworth will always be held high in gratitude and
esteem by the people of Ottawa and of many other cities and towns in the
Provinces of Ontario and Quebec. Mr. Butterworth is the son of William
and Matilda Catherine (Bissett) Butterworth. He is President and
Managing Director of the Ormstown Brick and Terra Cotta Co., of
Ormstown, Quebec; ex-Vice-President of the Montreal Terminal Railway;
ex-President of the Capital Power Company, of Deschene; ex-President,
Ottawa Cartage Company; and ex-President of the Capital Fuel Company. In
1879, Mr. Butterworth married Elisabeth J. Shaw, daughter of James Shaw,
Shawville, Quebec, a merchant in that place. He has two sons and two
daughters—Grace Winifred, John George Hawthorne, Ethel Gertrude, and
Wilfred Rosamond. One of his sons served as a lieutenant in the European
War. Mr. Butterworth is an Anglican in religion, and resides at 225
MacLaren St., Ottawa, Ont.

=Bell, John Percival=, General Manager of the Bank of Hamilton,
Hamilton, Ont., is recognized as one of the ablest of Canadian
financiers. He is a native of the city in which he resides, and from
early youth has grown up with the institution of which he is now the
executive head. He was born on June 8th, 1872, the son of John and Jane
(Park) Bell, and was educated in the public and high schools of
Hamilton. In 1888, as a lad of sixteen he entered the service of the
Bank of Hamilton as a junior clerk, and during the ensuing twelve years
learned every phase of the banking business. In 1900 he was appointed
manager of the Georgetown branch, and two years later was transferred to
the Berlin (now Kitchener) branch in a similar capacity. In 1904, he
became manager of the Brantford branch, one of the most important in the
territory of the institution, and remained there until 1909, when he
returned to Hamilton to become manager of the main office in that city.
In 1914, he was promoted to the position of General Manager on the
retirement from that position of Mr. James Turnbull, who, by a
coincidence had become General Manager of the Bank in the same year
(1888) that Mr. Bell entered its service. The five years of Mr. Bell’s
incumbency as General Manager have been the most difficult in the
history of Canadian finance, owing to the disruption caused by the great
war, and he has proven a brilliant success. He has carried on the policy
which has specially endeared the Bank of Hamilton to its clientele, by
caring for the interests of the business man of moderate resources with
the same zeal as is bestowed on those of the great corporations. Mr.
Bell is thoroughly in touch with the great and constantly expanding
business interests of his native city; and his regime has been marked by
an expansion of the Bank’s Toronto custom, as witnessed in the taking
over of the great office building and premises of the now extinct
Traders’ Bank in that city. He was elected a councillor of the Hamilton
Board of Trade in 1911, and during the war acted as Treasurer of the
Patriotic Fund for his district. His recreations are golf, bowling and
curling, and he is a member of the following clubs: Hamilton; Hamilton
Thistle; Hamilton Jockey; Royal Hamilton Yacht; Hamilton Golf; and the
Toronto Club (Toronto). In politics he is independent, and in religion
an Anglican. On Oct. 11th, 1900, he married Rosalind, daughter of Rev.
Arthur Boultbee, Toronto, and has two sons and three daughters. Mr. and
Mrs. Bell reside at 78 Chedske Ave., Hamilton.

=Noyes, John Powell=, Prothonotary Superior Court (Cowansville, Ont.),
was born at Potton, Brome County, Que., September 15th, 1842, the son of
Herman B. Noyes and Sarah Powell. Receiving his education in Bangor and
Fort Covington, N.Y., and St. Mary’s College, Montreal, from which last
he graduated in 1866, he studied law with the late Hon. L. S.
Huntington, Q.C., and the late Judge Laframboise. Mr. Noyes practised
his profession at Waterloo, Que., where he was also editor of the
“Advertiser,” and meeting with gratifying success became Batonnier of
Bedford District and K.C. in 1886; also Batonnier-General for the
Province of Quebec in 1887. In 1889 he was appointed a Royal
Commissioner to investigate the claim of the Hereford Railway Employees,
and in 1891 Joint Prothonotary Superior Court, Joint Clerk of the
Circuit Court, and Joint Clerk of the Crown and Peace for the District
of Bedford. In 1887 he was nominated for Shefford (Local) Constituency
in the Liberal interest but withdrew before the contest; his name has
also been mentioned as a candidate for the Judiciary. Mr. Noyes was the
first Mayor of the Town of Waterloo and for an extended period
Secretary-Treasurer of the Stanstead, Shefford & Chambly Railway Co., of
which he is now a director. He is the author of “Canadian Loyalists and
Early Settlers in the District of Bedford,” published in 1901, also of
“Some Pioneers of Shefford,” is a director of the Historical Society of
Missisquoi, and was elected President in 1904. He has been a Freemason
since 1866, having been a member of and sat in the Grand Lodges of
Canada and Quebec; he was grand Superintendent R. A. Masons, Eastern
Township District, in 1883; Grand First Principal, Grand Chapter of
Quebec in 1886-7; Deputy Grand Master, Grand Lodge of Quebec, in 1893,
and Grand Master of the above in 1894. Mr. Noyes married Lucy A.,
daughter of Joseph Merry of Magog, Que., in 1867, and has six
children—Egbert S., Jessie C., Laura M., Bertha A., Emily M. and Ralph
M. Noyes, of whom four survive. In 1913 he was named sole Prothonotary
of the District of Bedford and in 1916 was tendered a banquet by the
Judges, Bar and Court Officials of the District on the anniversary of
his admission to the Bar fifty years before, and of his appointment as
Joint Prothonotary twenty-five years before.

=Hughes, Brigadier-General William St. Pierre, D.S.O.= (Ottawa, Ont.).
On October 19, 1914, authority was granted to Lieut.-Colonel (now
Brigadier-General) William St. Pierre Hughes to organize an infantry
battalion to be absorbed into the Second Canadian Contingent for
Overseas Service. On the evening of May 5, the 21st was given a rousing
send-off by the citizens of Kingston, Ontario, and the following morning
the battalion embarked at Montreal on the S.S. Metagama for overseas.
Ten days later the 21st disembarked at Devonport, England, and on Sept.
15 it landed on French soil, and, in due time was under fire at
Messines, Vis-en-Artois, Neuville Villasse, Mercatel, Amiens, Bouley
Grenier, St. Eloi, Sanctuary Wood, Ancre, Vimy Ridge, Courcelette,
Mosselmark Village and Polderhook Chateau, Passchendaele, Bapaume,
Arras, Quichy-le-Chateau, the village of Damery and Parvillers, Cambrai,
and was one of the first battalions to cross the boundary at Bonn into
Germany. Before going overseas to serve in the Great War, General
William St. Pierre Hughes held the position of Inspector of
Penitentiaries, with headquarters in Ottawa. During his absence at the
front that office was abolished by Act of Parliament, and the new office
of Superintendent of Penitentiaries was established. The value to Canada
of General Hughes’ services as Inspector and as a competent and fearless
soldier during the war were well known to the Dominion Government, to
the members of Parliament, and to the general public, and when the
position of Superintendent was made public, members of Parliament, the
Press of Canada and the public in general were unanimous in General
Hughes’ favor, and he was appointed to the position. When he was
appointed to the position the “Montreal Gazette” said: “One of the
purposes of the Civil Service Commission is to select for appointment
worthy and capable men...... A case in point is the selection of
Major-General Hughes for the position of Superintendent of Dominion
Penitentiaries...... General Hughes comes of a fighting family in a
military sense, and the call of the colors has always found in him a
quick response even in the relatively remote days of 1885...... His
appointment is still more to be commended by reason of merit and
experience. He had long service in the Penitentiaries Branch of the
Department of Justice, in which he rose to the rank of Chief Inspector
before donning the uniform in defence of the Empire...... The
responsible duties of the office will be well discharged by one who
never failed in duty.” Brigadier-General William St. Pierre Hughes,
D.S.O., Superintendent of Penitentiaries, and brother of Major-General
Sir Sam Hughes, was born in Durham County, Ontario, June 2, 1863, and is
the son of John Hughes and Caroline Laughlin. From both sides of his
family he inherited military tastes, his father being the son of a
surgeon-major in the Imperial army who spent eighteen years in India,
and his mother the daughter of Colonel Laughlin of the 10th Royal Irish
Artillery and the granddaughter of Colonel St. Pierre, one of the most
famous of Napoleon’s colonels. General Hughes was educated entirely by
his father until his eleventh year, when he went to Toronto where he
remained six years. After a year at home he went to Winnipeg, where in
1885 he enlisted with the famous “Little Black Devils.” During his stay
in Winnipeg he won the amateur championship of Manitoba and the
North-West as a one-mile foot runner. After the Rebellion he returned to
Ontario, spending a year at college in Belleville; then a year in
Orillia where he played lacrosse with the Orillia team when that team
won the championship of Ontario; then to Cornwall, where he played with
the famous Cornwall lacrosse team during its years of national triumph.
In 1893, General Hughes became Warden’s Secretary and Clerk of
Industries in the Kingston Penitentiary, taking up what has become his
life’s work. After filling a number of different positions in
penitentiary work, during which he took a deep interest in criminology,
General Hughes became Inspector of Penitentiaries in 1913. With great
earnestness he started to put into effect many cherished plans for
prison reform, but the call of 1914 put an end for the time to this
work. During all the years of prison work General Hughes has kept in
close touch with military affairs. Starting as lieutenant in the old
14th Battalion of Kingston, he, in course of time, became
lieutenant-colonel commanding it, and was also brigade-major of the 7th
Canadian Infantry Brigade. General Hughes was in the West when war was
declared, and on his return in September, 1914, hurried to Valcartier,
but was then unable to get a place in the 1st Contingent, which had
already been mobilized. He then returned to Kingston and mobilized the
famous 21st Battalion. He commanded this battalion continuously until
July, 1916, when he was promoted to the command of the 10th Canadian
Infantry Brigade, which he commanded in France until the spring of 1917.
He then returned to England, where he commanded the Canadian area at
Crowborough until it was taken over by the Imperial army. General Hughes
then became president of a board for adjusting the financial differences
between the Imperial and Canadian authorities as regards barrack
damages, etc., and succeeded in writing off over $225,000 of charges
made by Imperials against Canadians, and also saving an amount of almost
$50,000 which was paid to Canadian Paymaster-General by various units in
settlement of these charges. During his service in France General Hughes
was awarded the D.S.O., and was twice mentioned in despatches. Owing to
a reorganization of the Penitentiary Branch, General Hughes was forced
to return to Canada in the summer of 1918, and was appointed
Superintendent of Penitentiaries in April, 1919. Prominent relatives of
General Hughes, besides Major-General Sir Sam Hughes, are Major John
Hughes and Dr. James L. Hughes, brothers. February 5, 1900, General
Hughes married Jessie Williams, daughter of William Macleod, of
Cornwall, Ontario. He has one son and one daughter, Major Laughlin
Macleod Hughes, R.C.H.A., and Mrs. John S. Gzowski, of Montreal, Quebec.
General Hughes is a member of the following societies: Masonic, Orange,
Odd-fellows and Foresters. For recreation he indulges in all-round
sports and big game hunting. He is a Presbyterian in religion, and
resides at 155 Stewart Street, Ottawa, Ontario.

=Gwatkin, Major-General W. G.= (Ottawa, Ont.), has been connected with
the military system of Canada since 1905. Except for rather less than
two years—between 1909 and 1911—his service with it has been
continuous, and he has been intimately concerned alike with the
preparations which were made for the Great War and with the staff work
at Headquarters during the course of the war. A Cambridge University
man, he joined the Manchester Regiment in 1882, and served as Subaltern,
Adjutant, Company Commander and Second in Command; in 1894 he passed the
Staff College; and in 1898 he began a long career on the Staff. Early in
1899 he went to the War Office to work in what ultimately became the
Mobilization Section, the organ of the War Office which had a great deal
to do, first, with the rapid and efficient supply of troops to South
Africa, and afterwards with the careful preparations which enabled the
regular army to show to such advantage in France. In the War Office
during this period he served under Colonel (now Lieut.-General) Sir
Percy Lake. In 1904, General Lake came to Canada to be the first Chief
of the General Staff, and in 1905 he brought Colonel Gwatkin (who had
been serving with his regiment in South Africa) to Ottawa to serve as
Director of Operations and Staff Duties—in other words, to be his
principal technical assistant. The reorganization of the Canadian
Militia which followed the South African War was beginning. In the years
between 1904 and 1914 the Militia force was remodelled, and a staff
system was founded which proved able to carry through the work of
raising and sending overseas an army of half a million men. Colonel
Gwatkin’s services were so highly regarded that the Minister of Militia
specially asked the War Office for an extension of his services, and he
remained in Canada, not for the regulation three years, but for four.
After a period of staff service in England his services were again
requested by the Canadian Government, and he came to Canada early in
1911. At that time the military authorities of the Empire had become
seriously apprehensive of war with Germany, and Colonel Gwatkin’s work
largely comprised such measures of organization for this emergency as
were undertaken in the circumstances. In particular he drew up complete
plans for the raising and despatch of a contingent to England in the
event of a war in Europe in which Canada might wish to participate. The
plan drawn up anticipated a large number of the points which arose when
the war actually came. In November, 1913, he succeeded Major-General C.
J. MacKenzie as Chief of the General Staff. He was filling this post
when the war came. The work done in the Militia Department in
preparation for such an eventuality proved of the utmost service. Cable
censorship was established, harbours were closed, dangerous points were
guarded, the transition from peace to a war which the general public had
not expected was made with remarkable smoothness. When the first
contingent sailed General Gwatkin was desired by the Government to stay
at Militia Headquarters to keep the machine working. During the entire
course of the war he performed enormous labours. To recruit, give
preliminary training to and ship overseas so large an army meant
administrative ability of a very high order and the discharge of an
immense amount of thankless labour. He has done his work to the high
satisfaction of the Government of Canada, whose principal military
adviser he has been. It showed its appreciation of his services by
insisting on retaining him, though the Imperial Government repeatedly
expressed a desire to recall him for service in Great Britain or France.
The details of his career are as follows:—Major-General Willoughby
Garnons Gwatkin, C.B., C.M.G., born August 11, 1859; was appointed

House, Twickenham, and Louisa Isabella, younger daughter of the Rev.
Ambrose Stapleton, vicar of East Budleigh, Devonshire. He was educated
at Shrewsbury School, at King’s College, Cambridge, and at R.M.C.,

=Ross, John Theodore, B.A.= (Quebec), is one of the leading capitalists
of the city. He was born in that city on Nov. 30, 1862, the son of the
late John Ross, a prominent merchant and his wife, Anne Runcie. The late
Senator J. G. Ross was his uncle. He was educated at Quebec High School,
at Morrin College and at McGill University, Montreal, from which latter
institution he graduated with the degree of B.A. in 1883. He entered the
wholesale business firm of his father, known as John Ross & Co., in
1884, and was admitted to full partnership in 1887, continuing in this
capacity until 1894 when the firm was liquidated. Since then he has been
widely engaged in financial and commercial operations. He was elected
Vice-President of the Quebec Bank in 1897 and President in 1908. On its
amalgamation with the Royal Bank of Canada some years later he became a
Director of the latter institution. Among his many other interests is
that of President of the Chronicle Printing Company, which publishes the
“Quebec Chronicle,” one of the historic newspapers of Eastern Canada.
His other commercial interests have at various times embraced the Quebec
Steamship Company, the Montmorency Cotton Mills Company, the McArthur
Export Company, The Quebec Improvement Company, the Trans-Canada Railway
Co., the Pacific Pass Coalfields, Ltd., the Quebec Transport Company,
the North Pacific Lumber Company. He has also taken a deep interest in

=Colquhoun, Arthur Hugh Urquhart, B.A., LL.D.=, Deputy Minister of
Education for the Province of Ontario, was born at Montreal on December
2, 1861, the son of the late Walter Colquhoun (a native of
Dumbartonshire, Scotland,) and his wife Jane, daughter of William
Clarke, Niagara, Ont., and relict of Charles Richardson, M.P. He was
educated at Cornwall Public School, Montreal High School (where he won
the Murray Medal for proficiency and the Governor-General’s Medal for
literature and history) and McGill University, from which he graduated
in 1885 with the degree of B.A., first class honors in English
literature and history, and the Shakespeare gold medal. During his
student days he took up the calling of journalism and joined the
editorial staff of the “Montreal Star” in 1881. In 1883 he was entrusted
with the post of editor-in-chief of the “Montreal Weekly Star,” and at
the same time edited the “McGill University Gazette.” In 1886 he went to
Ottawa and accepted the post of editor of the “Journal” of that city. In
1887, when the leaders of the Conservative government founded the
“Toronto Empire” as chief organ of the party, he was appointed assistant
editor and has ever since made Toronto his home. In 1891, he was
appointed managing editor of the “Empire” and continued in that capacity
until its amalgamation with the “Mail” in 1895. In the latter year, he
entered the growing field of trade journalism with Col. J. B. Maclean,
and until 1902 edited the “Printer and Publisher” and the “Dry Goods
Review.” In 1902, he joined the staff of the “Mail and Empire” as
editorial writer, and early in 1903, when Mr. J. S. (now Sir John)
Willison reorganized the “Toronto News,” he became news editor of that
publication, and helped to make the paper temporarily famous for the
literary distinction and importance of its news columns. From the outset
of the political career of the late Sir James Whitney, Mr. Colquhoun had
been his close personal friend and adviser. One of the pledges of that
statesman while leader of the opposition in the Ontario Legislature was
a reorganization of the educational system from top to bottom, and
shortly after his elevation to the post of Prime Minister in 1905 he
appointed a Royal Commission of distinguished men to enquire into the
affairs of the provincial university at Toronto. At the request of Mr.
Whitney, Mr. Colquhoun accepted the position of secretary of the
commission, and had much to do with the drafting of its report, which
proved to be one of the most important documents of its kind produced in
this country. In recognition of his services in this capacity, the
University conferred on him the honorary degree of LL.D. in 1906. In the
latter year he was also appointed Deputy Minister of Education, a
position he still holds, and was largely instrumental in putting into
effect the reforms promised by Sir James Whitney. In 1908, he was
offered and declined the post of Chief Librarian of the city of Toronto.
Among the earlier positions that he held was that of Chairman of the
Press Committee of the British Association when it met at Toronto in
1897, an occasion which brought to Canada many of the great scientists
of that day. He was also elected President of the Canadian Press
Association for 1906-7. Both before and since his retirement from
journalism, Mr. Colquhoun has been a frequent contributor, chiefly on
historical themes, to magazines and reviews, including “The Canadian
Magazine,” “The University Magazine,” “The British Empire Review,” and
“Queen’s Quarterly.” On the political history of the provinces of
Canada, he is a recognized authority; and his published works include
“The History of Canadian Press Association”; the volume on the Fathers
of Confederation in “The Chronicles of Canada,” and “Memoir of Senator
Gowan, C.M.G.” (which he edited). His books are marked by purity of
diction, and shrewd and moderate judgments on men and events. Mr.
Colquhoun is a member of the Toronto Club and the Toronto Golf Club, and
resides at 342 Walmer Road, Toronto.

=Nasmith, Colonel George Gallie= (Toronto, Ont.), who already enjoyed a
high reputation throughout Canada as a sanitary expert, has won added
distinction in the European War through brilliant services in his
special field. He was made Lieutenant-Colonel, August, 1914 (Colonel in
April, 1917), and Officer Commanding the Hydrological Corps, in which
capacity he had charge of the purification of the water supply at the
new Valcartier Military Camp during the mobilization of the First
Contingent. He was sent to England as adviser in sanitation in charge of
water purifications with the first contingent. While on Salisbury Plain,
he was useful in getting the remainder of the contingent inoculated
against typhoid; in installing a laboratory for the control of
cerebro-spinal meningitis, and in training men in the purification of
water. Colonel Nasmith was sent to France in March, 1915, as O.C. No. 5
(Canadian) Mobile Laboratory, where he conceived the idea of a mobile
filter unit for purifying any water supply, which has since been adopted
by the war office, and is now in general use among the British armies in
France, Mesopotamia, and elsewhere. He was present at the second battle
of Ypres, and saw the gas being discharged by the Germans for the first
time. He diagnosed its composition correctly, and reported it to General
Army Headquarters, recommending the use of masks to cover the face and
nose, saturated with hyposulphite of soda to absorb the gas. These were
adopted until experience enabled a more perfect type to be elaborated.
Other recommendations made by him in regard to gas and water
purification were also adopted. He was the representative of Canada on
the War Allies Sanitary Commission which met in Paris during 1916. In
January, 1916, he was mentioned in despatches, and made C.M.G. for
services in the field, being decorated by the King. Colonel Nasmith is a
Baptist in religion, and a Conservative in politics. He is a member of
the Academy of Medicine, of the American and Canadian Public Health
Associations, the Arts and Letters Club, and the Engineers Club, of
Toronto. Obtained the Diploma of Public Health from Toronto University
in 1918. He has published numerous general papers on foods, milk, water
purification, and sewage disposal, as well as conducting researches
which are embodied in the following papers:—“The Hæmatology of Carbon
Monoxide Poisoning,” “Changes Induced in the Blood of Guinea Pigs in an
Atmosphere of Coal Gas,” “A Simple Method of Purifying Almost any Water
Supply,” “A New Type of Trickling Filter,” “A Mobile Filter of Large
Capacity Suggested for Use in the British Army,” “The Chemistry of Wheat
Gluten,” and “Wind Driven Currents in the Great Lakes.” He is also
author of “On the Fringe of the Great Fight,” published 1918, and
“Canada’s Sons and Great Britain in the Great War,” published 1919.
Colonel Nasmith is greatly interested in music, painting, and the drama,
as well as in horticulture and sailing. From 1903 to 1909 he was Chemist
to the Provincial Board of Health of Ontario, and from 1909 to date
Director of Laboratories, Department of Health, Toronto. He was born in
Toronto in 1877, the son of Mungo Nasmith, of Greenock, Scotland, and
Jane Morrow, of Bath, England. He was educated at Jarvis Street
Collegiate and the University of Toronto, graduating as a B.A. in 1900
and as M.A. and Ph.D. in 1903, also receiving the Honorary Degree of
D.Sc. in 1917 from his alma mater in recognition of his scientific work
with the British Army in France. Colonel Nasmith married Mrs. Scott
Roff, Principal of the Margaret Eaton School of Literature and
Expression, and daughter of the late Rev. James Scott, Owen Sound,
Ontario, in 1916.

distinguished career at Quebec Seminary and Laval University, he
graduated from the latter institution of learning in 1873 with the
degree of LL.L., receiving the higher honor of LL.D. in 1878. Mr.
Justice Flynn has been prominent in Provincial politics during a public
life of some thirty years, during which time he was M.L.A. for the
constituencies of Gaspé and Nicolet respectively, and held office
successively as Commissioner of Crown Lands, Minister of Railways,
Solicitor-General and Commissioner of Public Works in various
Liberal-Conservative Administrations; from May, 1896, to May, 1897, he

Opposition. In 1908, he was candidate for House of Commons in Dorchester
Co., but was defeated by a comparatively small majority. Between the
years 1874 and 1914 when he received his appointment as Judge, Mr. Flynn
was a practising lawyer at the Quebec Bar and Professor of Roman Law in
Laval, of which University he is to-day Dean in the Faculty of Law;
having also been Batonnier of the Quebec Bar. A Roman Catholic in

=Willis, James E.= (Whitby, Ont.), is one of the best known and
progressive citizens of that town. At present he holds the position of
police magistrate for the town, but has been identified with public
affairs in various capacities for some years past. While still
comparatively young in years, he built up a successful position in the
business world, and at the time of his appointment to his legal office
in 1918, filled the office of President of the Whitby Board of Trade. He
has also taken an active part in municipal affairs, and held the office
of Mayor of the town for two terms. Another office which he has filled
with success is that of Chairman of the Public Utilities Commission of
the town. It was while Mayor of Whitby that he became identified with
the movement to extend the scope and usefulness of the hydro-electric
system of Ontario. It was the desire of Sir Adam Beck and his chief
lieutenants that the system already so widely used for manufacturing,
municipal and domestic purposes should be augmented by a great network
of radial railways. Under Mayor Willis’s advice, the town of Whitby was
the first municipality in Ontario to avail itself of these proposals by
extending municipal support to a hydro-electric radial railway linking
up Toronto with the towns of Whitby, Markham and Port Perry; and it is
expected that the road when constructed and put in operation will do
much for the entire section immediately east of Toronto. Another local
enterprise which was in the main due to Mr. Willis’s progressive spirit
was the installing of a sewerage system, which was essential to the
establishment near the town of Whitby of a great provincial hospital for
the insane, which, during the war was turned over to the military
authorities, and was the largest soldiers’ hospital in the Dominion of
Canada. When the plans which Mr. Willis has done so much to promote are
carried out, Whitby will have a close suburban connection by electric
railway with Toronto, and it is expected will become an important
residential centre for the wealthier families of that city. When the
late Major Harper, who had formerly served as police magistrate, passed
away in 1918, the Attorney-General of Ontario appointed Mr. Willis his
successor; and the choice was applauded not merely locally, but in wider
circles where the activities of Mr. Willis for the development of Whitby
had rendered his name familiar. He is recognized as one of the most
forceful and progressive municipal authorities in Canada. In his younger
days he took an active interest in outdoor sports, such as foot racing,
cricket, baseball, and was secretary of the Whitby Curling Club for many
years, and took part as skip in many Tankard and friendly matches. He
has been from his youth a reader, and is one of the best posted men on
general and scientific subjects in his native town. It has been his
policy to strongly advocate any movement that would be for the good and
uplifting of the people as a whole; and he has often been heard to say:
“I wish I could do some lasting good for my fellow man, and leave the
world a little better than I found it. If I can do no permanent and
lasting good, I feel that I have lived in vain.”

=Langton, Brigadier-General Joseph Graham=, Paymaster-General of the
Militia Department, Ottawa, is the son of Thomas Langton, a merchant,
and Fannie McKim Langton, and was born at Toronto, October 14, 1868,
where he received his education in the public schools and the Jarvis
Street Collegiate Institute. He has had an extensive military career,
and has served continuously in the active militia of Canada since 1886.
He joined the Queen’s Own Rifles in May, 1886, and served continuously
until December, 1896. He served for two and a half years as regimental
drill instructor, and in 1895 organized the Queen’s Own Rifle Cyclist
section. In 1897, he received a commission as Lieutenant in the 20th
Lorne Rifles, was promoted as Captain in 1898, and held appointment as
Adjutant until 1903. He was selected by Militia Headquarters to organize
No. 2 Company Canadian Army Service Corps, and in 1903 at Niagara Camp
commanded the first Army Service Corps unit to go under canvas in
Canada. In June, 1905, he was appointed Senior Army Service Corps
Officer, Western Ontario Command, on the Staff of Brigadier-General W.
D. Otter, C.B., and held that appointment until June, 1911, when the
tenure of appointment expired. In 1898, he instituted the first
regimental system of messing at the Canadian Militia Training Camps at
Niagara Camp. At the Tercentenary Celebration at Quebec, July, 1908, he
was appointed as Deputy-Assistant-Quarter-Master-General, and had charge
of the railway transportation of troops. A field order issued by the
late Lord Roberts conveyed the congratulations of the present King, then
the Prince of Wales, to the late Sir Frederick Borden on the success of
the transport arrangements. General Langton instituted the first use of
mechanical transport by the Canadian Militia at the Fall manœuvres at
Toronto in October, 1910. He was appointed railway transport officer for
mobilization of the first Canadian contingent at Valcartier in August,
1914, and in co-operation with Sir William Price had charge of the
embarkation of the first contingent at Quebec in September of the same
year. In December, 1915, he was appointed Inspector of Supplies and
Transport for the Second Divisional Area, and by Order-in-Council,
February, 1916, he was attached to the Staff of the Inspector-General
and appointed as Chief Supply Inspector for Eastern Canada. In the
following June he was appointed as Deputy Inspector-General. February 8,
1918, he was appointed as Paymaster-General and as a member of the
Militia Council. As Deputy Inspector-General, General Langton had
supervision over receipts, supplies, stores, clothing, accounting,
regimental funds, mess accounts, and canteen funds. In the matter of
canteens, General Langton is recognized as the leading authority in
Canada on their administration. The booklet of rules for the management
of canteens, regimental funds, etc., issued by the Militia Department as
a text-book for the troops, was prepared by him. The branch under his
administration effected a saving during the war of over one million
dollars without depriving the troops of anything to which they were
entitled. In his capacity as Paymaster-General he has entire charge of
the finances—separations allowance and assigned pay branch of the
Militia Department, etc. General Langton is Vice-President of the
Military Service Department of the Young Men’s Christian Association.
This department was first attached to the Canadian Military Camps at
Valcartier in August, 1914, by General Sir Sam Hughes on the
recommendation of General Langton. In recognition of his services
General Langton has been recommended for distinguished services in
Canada. Until he entered upon his duties as Deputy Inspector-General,
General Langton has been engaged in banking and other financial
pursuits. General Joseph Graham Langton, on Oct. 7, 1891, married
Margaret J., daughter of John Pearey, contractor, of Toronto. Five
children have blessed the union: Percy (deceased), Ernest Pearey
(deceased), Olive V., Joseph McKim, and Florence Margaret. General

=Graham, Hon. George Perry= (Brockville, Ont.), is one of the leading
public men of Canada, and a former cabinet minister. He was born on
March 31, 1859, at Eganville, Ont., and is of Irish descent. He was
educated at Iroquois and Morrisburg High Schools in the St. Lawrence
Valley. He early became identified with journalism, and as editor and
manager of the Brockville “Recorder,” made it one of the best known
provincial papers in the Dominion. An earlier newspaper enterprise of
his was the Morrisburg “Herald,” which he successfully conducted for
eleven years; and he was for a short time associate editor of the Ottawa
“Free Press.” As a young man, Mr. Graham became identified with the
organization of the Liberal party in his district, and was in great
demand as a platform speaker. Entry into public life was a logical
outcome of his career as a moulder of public opinion. During his
residence in Morrisburg, Ont., he was Reeve of the village and a member
of the County Council, and in 1894 the Liberals nominated him for the
riding of Dundas against no less an opponent than J. P. Whitney,
afterwards Prime Minister of Ontario. At the general elections for the
Legislature in 1898 he was Liberal candidate for Brockville, and was
more successful, securing election by a substantial majority. He at once
achieved a prominent position in the Legislature owing to his wit and
skill as a debater. Those were the days when Mr. Whitney was making his
long and ultimately successful fight for the overthrow of the Ross
Government, and the former contestants in the riding of Dundas
frequently crossed swords in debate. At the Legislative elections in
1902, Mr. Graham was re-elected for Brockville, though his party
suffered heavy losses elsewhere, and on November 25, 1904, on the
resignation of the late Hon. J. R. Stratton from the post of Provincial
Secretary, he was called to the cabinet as his successor. At the general
elections of the ensuing winter he was again returned for Brockville,
but the Ross Government, of which he was a member, was defeated. On
January 25, 1907, the Liberal caucus elected him leader of His Majesty’s
loyal opposition, but he served in that capacity for only one session of
the Legislature. In August of 1907, Sir Wilfrid Laurier induced him to
abandon the provincial field, and offered him the portfolio of Railways
and Canals in the Federal cabinet. He was sworn in as a member of the
Privy Council on August 29, and on September 18, 1907, was elected by
acclamation to the House of Commons for the Federal riding of
Brockville. He continued as Minister of Railways for four years, and
took an active part in the organization of his party in Ontario. In
September, 1911, the Laurier administration was defeated at the polls.
Mr. Graham was elected in a by-election in South Renfrew, and for the
next six years continued to sit in opposition as the desk-mate of Sir
Wilfrid Laurier. He did not seek re-election at the general elections of
1917, but has retained active connection with the Liberal party, and in
many quarters his name was urged as the fitting successor of Sir Wilfrid
Laurier in the party leadership. In addition to his journalistic and
political activities, Mr. Graham is widely known in connection with
fraternal insurance organizations. He was Grand Master of the Ancient
Order of United Workmen for two years, and for a considerable period a
member of the Finance Committee of that body. He is President of the
Travellers’ Life Assurance Company of Canada, a Director of the Canada
Foundries and Forging Company, Vice-President of Delaney Forge Company,
and President of the “Recorder” Printing Company. In religion he is a
Methodist. In 1882, he married Carrie, a daughter of Nelson Southworth,
Morrisburg, Ont., and had two sons, Captain Perry M., who died some
years ago, and Captain W. N., who was killed in the Great War.

=Leonard, Lieutenant-Colonel Reuben Wells=, Corps of Guides (St.
Catharines, Ont.). Born at Brantford, Ont., February 21, 1860, son of
the late Francis Henry Leonard (one time Reeve of the town of Brantford
and Warden of the County of Brant) and Elizabeth, daughter of the late
Captain Richard Catton. He was educated at the Brantford Collegiate
Institute and Royal Military College of Canada, Kingston, from which
latter he graduated in 1883, winning the Silver Medal.
Lieutenant-Colonel Leonard has had a wide experience in several branches
of his chosen profession of engineering, having occupied positions of
increasing importance in railroad, hydro-electric, and mining
development. After completing his education in 1883, he took service
with the Canadian Pacific Railway as instrumentman on surveys and
resident engineer on construction of the Lake Superior Division. At the
outbreak of the North-West Rebellion in 1885 he was appointed Staff
Officer of Transport, and served in other capacities during the
uprising. After the Rebellion he re-entered the service of the Canadian
Pacific as engineer of surveys and construction in Manitoba and Ontario.
From 1886 until 1890, he was chief engineer of the Cumberland Railway
and Coal Co., in Nova Scotia. 1890-1891 he was again with the Canadian
Pacific Railway on surveys of important branch lines in Ontario, Quebec,
and British Columbia. In 1891-92 he was engaged in railway contracting.
In 1892-93 he was in charge of the construction of the first
hydro-electric development at Niagara Falls, Ont., for the Park and
River Railway Co. In 1893-94 he was engineer-in-charge of railway
surveys for the Canadian Pacific Railway. From 1895 until 1899 he was
chief engineer and manager of construction of the St. Lawrence and
Adirondack Railway, and of the Montreal and Ottawa Short Line (C.P.R.)
respectively, and consulting engineer for the Canadian Rutland Railway.
His next step was again in the field of mining engineering, being
engaged as engineer with the Lake Superior Corporation in developing
their iron and nickel mines in the Sudbury and Michipicoten districts.
In 1900, he returned to railroading as chief engineer and manager of
construction of the Cape Breton Railway. From 1902 to 1904, he was
engineer in charge of the construction of a hydro-electric plant at
DeCew Falls, near St. Catharines, for the Hamilton Cataract Power Co.,
and in 1905-06 he was engaged in similar work at Kakabeka Falls, near
Fort William, for the Kaministiquia Power Co. In 1905, when silver was
first discovered in Northern Ontario, Colonel Leonard was one of the
first prospectors in the Cobalt district and staked the Buffalo mine,
and in the following year he acquired a controlling interest in the
Coniagas mine, and promoted the Coniagas Mines, Ltd., of which he is
President. This mine has been one of the largest and most consistent
producers of silver ore in the rich Cobalt district, and during its ten
years of operation has produced 25,000,000 ounces of silver, and is
still one of the few silver-producing mines of Canada. In 1908 a
subsidiary company—the Coniagas Reduction Co., Ltd., was formed
primarily for the purpose of treating ore from the Coniagas mine, but a
large custom trade has also been developed in the smelting and reduction
of cobalt ores for the production of silver and lesser products. In
1911, Lieutenant-Colonel Leonard was selected by the Dominion Government
for the position of Chairman of the National Transcontinental Railway
Commission at Ottawa, with jurisdiction over the construction of the
Government Railway from Moncton, N.B., to Winnipeg. This position he
occupied, at much personal sacrifice, until the practical completion of
the railway in 1914. Next to the mining industry, Colonel Leonard’s
principal interest would appear to lie in the direction of the steel
business, as his name appears on the directorate of several industries
engaged in the manufacture of steel and steel products. He has recently
promoted the organization of a new steel company, under the name of
Electric Steel and Engineering Ltd., which is an amalgamation of several
engineering enterprises in which he is interested, and whose different
lines of manufacture he found could be co-ordinated to advantage. He is
also a Director of the Toronto General Trusts Corporation. It may be
said here that he is one of those men of business who are not content to
be Directors in name only, but who believe in the principle that a
Director should take a part in the actual direction of the enterprises
with which he permits his name to become identified, and in conformity
with this rule he has consistently declined to accept office as Director
of commercial enterprises when he felt he was not in a position to give
the necessary time and attention to the affairs of the business. Colonel
Leonard has always taken a keen interest in the welfare and advancement
of the engineering profession, and is an active member and past
vice-president of the Canadian Society of Civil Engineers and the
Canadian Mining Institute; President Engineering Institute of Canada,
1919-20. He has always been the friend of the young engineer, and ever
ready to lend a hand in helping him along the road to success. He is
also a past corresponding member of the Council of the Institute of
Mining and Metallurgy, London, England, and a member of the American
Institute of Mining Engineers. Member Institution of Civil Engineers,
London, England. In spite of his many business activities, he finds time
to devote to educational interests, and is a close student of all
questions involving the well-being and good government of the State. He
is a true Imperialist and advocate of closer unity between the component
parts of the Empire; and any movement which promises to assist in
attaining this end has his moral and financial support. He is a member
of the Board of Governors of the University of Toronto; the Kingston
School of Mining; Wycliffe College, Toronto; and Ridley College, St.
Catharines, Ont. He has recently established scholarships under “The
Leonard Foundation” in several of these Institutions to assist in the
education and support of sons of clergymen, school teachers and officers
and men of the Canadian and Imperial army and navy who require
assistance in order to complete their education. His other benefactions
are widely distributed and unheralded, and it is safe to say that few
appeals on behalf of deserving objects are made to him in vain. A
characteristic which strikes one forcibly is his ability to quickly
analyse and grasp the essentials of things, and this faculty enables him
to get through a large amount of work in a limited time, and also to
readily appreciate the merits or demerits of things, whether in
business, politics or the various public movements with which he may be
asked to become identified. Since the outbreak of war, he has given much
of his time and means to patriotic movements and other work tending to
promote Canada’s whole-hearted participation in the war.
Lieutenant-Colonel Leonard is in command of No. 2 Detachment, Corps of
Guides. He is a member of the Mount Royal Club, Montreal; Rideau and
Country Clubs, Ottawa; National Club and the Engineers’ Club, Toronto,
and the Tourilli Fish and Game Club, Quebec. He is an ardent advocate of
all outdoor sports, especially in the woods. He is an independent in
politics, and in religion an Anglican. Married in 1889 to Kate Rowlands,
daughter of the late John Rowlands, of Kingston, Ont.

=Hare, Rev. John James, M.A., Ph.D.=, Principal Emeritus of Ontario
Ladies’ College (Whitby, Ont.), is one of the most distinguished of
Canadian educationists. He was born in Nepean township, Ontario, on
October 3, 1847, the son of Robert and Barbara (Shillington) Hare. His
early education was received in the public school of his district, and
later he entered Victoria University, at that time situated at Cobourg,
Ont., with a view to entering the Methodist ministry. He graduated in
1873 with the degree of B.A., winning first prizes in metaphysics,
Hebrew, Scripture and debating, also a scholarship for highest standing
in his sophomore year. In 1876, he qualified for the M.A. degree of his
alma mater, and subsequently was awarded the degree of Ph.D. by the
Illinois Wesleyan University. Incidentally he had served as a public
school teacher for two years, and was ordained for the ministry in 1873.
For one year he served as a pastor at London, Ont., but in 1874 was
appointed principal of the Ontario Ladies’ College at Whitby, Ont., an
institution founded for the education of Methodist young women, but by
no means exclusively denominational. That position Dr. Hare held
continuously for forty-one years. In 1915 he resigned, and was appointed
principal emeritus. In 1879 he became governor as well as principal. In
the conduct of the institution he has shown rare executive ability, and
to this asset, combined with his indefatigable energy and spirit of
devotion to the interests of his pupils, the great success of the
college is attributable. During his regime, the institution was four
times enlarged by the addition of Ryerson Hall, private residence with
connecting passage, Frances Hall, gymnasium, swimming pool and hospital
to provide against an outbreak of a contagious disease. By a vast number
of Canadian women, some of whom are now in middle age, the name of Dr.
Hare is held in honor and veneration. His educational attainments were
some years ago recognized by his selection as examiner in geology by the
University of Toronto. In September, 1874, he married Katherine
Isabella, daughter of the late Rev. D. C. McDowell, a well-known
Methodist divine, and has one son. Mrs. Hare was for some years lady
principal of the college, and discharged the duties of her position with
efficiency. His recreations are riding, driving and tennis; and in
politics he is an independent. His permanent address is 164 Bird Ave.,
Miami, Florida.

=Ashton, Major-General Ernest, M.D., C.M.G.=, is one of those Canadian
soldiers who won high rank and distinction during the great war, but was
originally a physician by profession. He was born at Brantford, Ont., on
October 28, 1875, the son of Rev. Robert and Alice Mary Ashton. His
father was formerly Principal of the Mohawk Institute, Brantford, and
incumbent of His Majesty’s Chapel of Mohawks. He was educated for the
calling of a physician at Trinity Medical School, and graduated in 1898
with the following degrees and honours: F.I.M.C., M.D., C.M. of Trinity
University, and was medallist of both Trinity Medical School and Trinity
University. On graduation he became house surgeon of the Hospital for
Sick Children, Toronto, holding that position for one year, after which
he was appointed superintendent of the Muskoka Cottage Sanitarium, near
Gravenhurst, Ont., remaining there for two years. In 1901 he returned to
Brantford, Ont., and built up a large general practice. He also entered
municipal politics and served as alderman and as a member of the Board
of Education. He was one of the Board of Governors of Brantford General
Hospital and the Brantford Sanitarium. The volunteer militia likewise
claimed much of his energy and enthusiasm, and he holds a first class
school of infantry certificate. When but eighteen years of age he joined
the Dufferin Rifles of Brantford as second lieutenant, and was gazetted
on January 20, 1893. He became a full lieutenant in September of that
year; Captain on August 7, 1896; Major, December 29, 1902; and
Lieutenant-Colonel on January 8, 1907, being at that time one of the
youngest militia commanders in Canada. On completing his five years’
tenure on January 7, 1912, he gave up his command, and was transferred
to the Reserve of Officers of the Canadian Militia. The following year
he was returned to the active list on the organization of the 13th
Brigade, Canadian Field Artillery, and raised and on July 1, 1913,
assumed command of the 32nd Howitzer Battery, C.F.A., with the rank of
Lieutenant-Colonel. On the outbreak of the great war in the following
year he at once offered his services, and on January 2, 1915, was
appointed to raise and organize the 36th Battalion, C.E.F., and within
six months had so effectively performed his task that he was able to
proceed overseas with his battalion on June 19, 1915. On arrival in
England, the organization was broken up and sent to France as
re-inforcements for other battalions; and its commanding officer was
appointed Brigadier of the 9th Reserve Infantry Brigade, and promoted to
the rank of Colonel. On November 7, 1916, he was appointed O.C. of the
Canadian Training Division, and about the same time acted as one of the
Board headed by Surgeon-General Sir William Baptie to investigate the
charges preferred by Colonel Herbert A. Bruce against the organization
of the Canadian Army Medical Corps. On March 16, 1917, he became
temporary Brigadier-General and on April 2 of that year was appointed
General Officer Commanding of the 15th Canadian Infantry Brigade. His
valuable services were the subject of official mention on February 24,
1917 and August 7, 1917. In the autumn of that year he was recalled to
Canada, and on January 1, 1918 appointed Acting-Adjutant-General and
Major-General. At the same time he received the honour of C.M.G. from
His Majesty the King. On June 8, 1905, General Ashton was married to
Helen Margaret, daughter of Oswald Weir, banker, of the Bank of North
America, Brantford, Ont.; he has one child, Amy Corcaire Ashton. He is
an Anglican in religion, and in politics a man of strongly Imperialistic
leanings. He is a member of the Rideau Club, Ottawa, and the Ottawa Golf
Club.

=Duff, Hon. Lyman Poore=, is one of the Justices of the Supreme Court of
Canada, and one of the mostly widely-known of Canadian jurists. He was
born at Meaford, Ontario, on January 7, 1865, the son of Rev. Charles
and Isabel (Johnstone) Duff. He was educated in the public and high
schools of the province and at the University of Toronto, from which he
graduated with the degree of B.A. in 1887 and first class honors in
mathematics and metaphysics. He also took up the study of law at Osgoode
Hall, Toronto, and received the degree of LL.B. at Toronto University in
1889. For a time he was teacher of mathematics at Barrie Collegiate
Institute, but was called to the Bar of Ontario in 1893, and in the same
year to that of British Columbia in 1895. He first practised in Fergus,
Wellington County, Ont., for two years, and in 1895 removed to Victoria,
B.C., where he built up a large and important practice. He was created a
King’s Counsel in 1901, and in that year represented the province of
British Columbia in the famous Deadman’s Island case. In 1903, he was
one of the counsel in the enquiry into the Columbian and Western land
subsidies, a matter which attracted a great deal of attention on the
Pacific Coast at that time. In 1903, he had the honor of being
associated as counsel with the late Hon. Edward Blake, K.C., and the
late Christopher Robinson, K.C., in representing the Dominion of Canada
before the joint high commission on the Alaskan Boundary dispute, which
sat in London, England. He received appointment as Puisne Judge of the
Supreme Court of Canada in 1904, and in 1906 was elevated to his present
position as one of the Justices of the Supreme Court at Ottawa. In that
capacity he had made important decisions on questions of the highest
moment, and in 1918 was appointed as supreme authority in connection
with appeals against the operation of the Military Service Act. He is a
man of strong and striking personality as well as of the highest
judicial attainments, and in many quarters it has been suggested that he
leave the bench to enter political life, which, however, holds out no
attraction for him. When in private practice he was a Liberal, and for a
time held the position of President of the Victoria Liberal Club. He is
a member of the Rideau Club, Ottawa, Ottawa Country Club, Union Club,
Victoria, B.C., Vancouver Club. In July, 1898, he married Elizabeth
Eleanor, daughter of Henry Bird, Barrie, Ont, and resides on Goulborn

=Hurdman, George Charles, M.P.P.=, is a prominent lumberman of Ottawa,
and one of the representatives of that city in the Ontario legislature.
He was born in Ottawa on September 23, 1870, the son of George and Agnes
C. (Fraser) Hurdman. On both sides he is of United Empire Loyalist
stock, and is of Irish and Scottish descent. He was educated at the
public and Model schools of his native city, and as a lad of nineteen
became connected with the wholesale lumber industry, with which he has
ever since been identified. He first entered the service of Beull, Orr,
Hurdman & Co., with which he was connected for five years; after which
he was associated with the lumber firm of Shepherd and Morse, Boston,
Massachusetts, for another five years. In 1899 he established the
Hurdman Lumber Company, Limited, of which he is the head. He has offices
in Canada Life Building, Ottawa, and conducts an extensive wholesale
business. He is also Secretary-Treasurer of the Canada Quarries and
Construction Co. of Ottawa. From earlier manhood, Mr. Hurdman has taken
a strong interest in public affairs, and was for several years an active
officer of the executive of the Liberal party in Ottawa. At the general
elections for the Ontario Legislature in June, 1914, he was the
candidate of his party for the riding of Ottawa West, and succeeded in
defeating his opponent, ex-Mayor Ellis, a strong candidate, by a safe
majority. As a member of the opposition he has proved most useful, his
counsel being especially valued in committee work, and in the party
caucus. He has also taken an active interest in military affairs, and as
a young man served with the 43rd Regiment, Ottawa, and Carleton Rifles.
When the war broke out in 1914, he decided to resume military service,
and qualified as an officer in the Princess Louise Dragoon Guards, which
sent many recruits to the front. He is a Methodist in religion, and a
charter member of the Laurentian Club, Ottawa, and his chief recreation
is horsemanship. On June 21, 1899, he married Katherine, daughter of
Thomas J. Lynton, Ottawa, and has three sons, George Charles, Thomas
Lynton, and Herbert Russell Hurdman. He resides at 412 Daly Ave.,
Ottawa.

Limited. He was born at L’Orignal, Ontario, in 1881, and is a son of
Joseph Lever Bates. He was educated at the public and high schools of
Hawkesbury, Ont., and as a lad of nineteen went into the insurance
business as an agent for the New York Life Insurance Company at Ottawa.
He proved one of the most successful writers of policies that this
country has produced, and in 1904 made the Canadian record for his
company by obtaining one hundred and seven applications for insurance in
the space of thirty-five days. He was appointed Superintendent of
Agencies for the company, and continued in that position until 1907. In
that year the International Land and Lumber Company and the British
Canadian Industrial Company were organized, and he was connected with
them from their inception. Under his energetic and enterprising
direction, they have developed a large and substantial business. In
politics Mr. Bates is a Conservative, and in religion a Methodist. He is
a member of the Laurentian Club; the Britannia Boat Club and the
Canadian Club, Ottawa. On September 21, 1909, he married Maud, daughter
of Thomas Askwith, Ottawa, and has two sons. Mr. and Mrs. Bates reside

=Rose, George Maclean=, President and Manager of the Hunter-Rose
Company, Limited, Toronto, comes of a family which has been identified
with the printing and publishing industry in Canada since the
pre-Confederation era. He was born at the city of Quebec on October 30,
1865, the son of the late George Maclean Rose and his wife, Margaret
Levack Manson, both natives of Caithness, Scotland. Sir Oliver Mowat,
the famous Liberal statesman, who was for nearly a quarter of a century
Prime Minister of Ontario, and held other very important public offices,
was a cousin of the late Mrs. Rose. The subject of this sketch was
educated at the Model School and the Wellesley School, Toronto, and
later took a course at the Ontario Agricultural College, Guelph, with a
view to embarking in a career of scientific agriculture, a project
subsequently abandoned. He began his business career with the Williams,
Greene & Rome Company, Ltd., manufacturers of men’s wear at Kitchener
(then Berlin), Ont., and became secretary and a director of the company.
Severing connection with the enterprise, he went to New York, and was
engaged in business there for ten years, returning to Canada in 1902 to
join the Hunter-Rose Company, established many years previously by his
father. He acted as secretary of the company for two years, and in 1904
became President and Manager, the position he holds to-day. The
Hunter-Rose Company is one of the historic commercial concerns of
Canada. Its founder, the late George Maclean Rose, was a native of Wick,
Caithness, who, as a young man in Scotland acquired complete familiarity
with every phase of the printing and publishing business. In the middle
fifties he came to Canada, and settled in Montreal, but in 1857 went to
London, Ont., and in company with the late Hamilton Hunter established
the printing firm of Hunter & Rose. This partnership was, however,
short-lived, and in 1859, Mr. Rose joined forces with the late Samuel
Thompson, of Toronto, who had received the contract to execute the
printing for the parliament of Canada. This necessitated removal to
Quebec, at that time capital of Canada. It shortly became necessary for
Mr. Thompson to retire from business, and to carry on the work of
government printing Mr. Rose formed the firm of Hunter-Rose & Company,
in the ancient capital, taking into partnership Robert Hunter, a
practical accountant. The completion of the parliament buildings at
Ottawa in 1865 and the establishment of the government there,
necessitated removal to that city, which remained the headquarters of
the firm for several years. Confederation, in the meantime, having
become an established fact, Hon. John Sandfield Macdonald, the first
Premier of Ontario, induced Mr. Rose to establish a branch in Toronto,
to take charge of the provincial printing. In 1871, Mr. Rose came to
Toronto to reside permanently, and since that time the name Hunter-Rose
& Company has been identified with the commercial life of Toronto. In
1877, Mr. Robert Hunter died, and Mr. Rose became sole proprietor. The
firm was incorporated under its present name in 1895. Government
printing ceased to be the staple of its business many years ago, and
book publishing became a very important part of its activities. From its
plant have been issued many reprints of the leading authors of the past
and present century. Incidentally, it may be mentioned that the first
volume of “Representative Canadians,” edited by the late George Maclean
Rose, was published in 1886. The present head of the company, who has
carried on the historic traditions of the firm, is a member of the
Canadian Manufacturers Association and of the Toronto Board of Trade. As
a young man, he took a deep interest in military matters, and was a
Lieutenant in the 48th Highlanders of Toronto, when that regiment was
first established. He was also a lacrosse enthusiast, and played with
the old Ontarios of Toronto and the Crescents of Brooklyn, N.Y. His
present recreation is golf, and he is a member of the Ontario Club, the
Simcoe Club, the Lakeview Golf Club, and the Ontario Jockey Club. In
religion he is a Unitarian, and in politics independent.

=Blair, Lieutenant James K.= (Ottawa, Ont.), who was killed in action at
the Somme October 2, 1916, was born September 11, 1890, at Truro, Nova
Scotia, the only son of Lieutenant-Colonel H. C. Blair, Inspector of
Customs, Ottawa, and Grace Ewart Blair. He received his education in the
common schools of Truro, and was a commercial traveller when he enlisted
at Saskatoon as a private on the outbreak of the war. He was married
early in 1916 to Dulcie, daughter of Captain Brooks of the Indian Army,
and Mrs. Brooks, and is survived by one son, James K. Blair, whom he
never saw. After enlisting, he trained with the 28th Battalion in
Winnipeg, and on receiving a commission in February, 1915, joined the
46th Battalion at Moose Jaw, and left for England with a draft from the
battalion in July, 1915. He qualified at Hythe as a musketry instructor,
and was attached in that capacity to the 32nd Reserve Battalion, where
he served for one year. He went to France on August 2, 1916, where he
joined the 2nd Canadian Entrenching Battalion, and then went to his old
battalion the 28th. The following extract from a letter written by the
Commanding officer of the 28th is a tribute to Lieutenant Blair’s
military abilities:—“Poor Jimmie Blair never had a chance to do more
than show he had the grit to stick the worst the Boche could do. He
joined us when we were on our way south, and fitted easily into the very
happy family our mess then was. He did what he had to do well, and gave
entire satisfaction. As our Battalion was then in a high state of
efficiency, that is a good recommendation to any officer. In the big
attack of September 15, we only took in half our officers, and
Lieutenant Blair was left out, so he did not get the chance which two of
the officers of his company got, and which resulted in the award to them
of the M.C. We went in again on September 24-25, and Blair’s platoon was
in the centre, and was subjected to very severe shelling during all of
which he carried himself coolly and bravely, and came through in good
shape. After a couple of days back we went in again on another sector to
hold. Blair’s company was in Kenora trench, just where it joins Regina
trench, of which so much has been said in the papers. This was really a
communication trench, but had to be held on account of the command it
gave us for future operations. It was, however, badly enfiladed, and we
had practically all our casualties there. The battalion we relieved had
just captured it, and it was subjected to a good deal of shell fire, and
it was during one of these poor Blair was killed by a small shell which
landed in the bay in which he was posted. I gave orders that his body be
brought out for burial, but a heavy rain and resulting mud, together
with the exhausted condition of our men, made this impossible. He was,
therefore, given a soldier’s grave near where he fell, and on ground
which should be considered sacred to Canadians, as many of our officers
and men had fallen, and have fallen since, before Regina trench was
finally captured. He died, therefore, as so many have, just ”holding the
line,“ nothing spectacular; just a matter of duty well and bravely done
under very trying circumstances. He gave promise of doing well, but he
was not given the opportunity which the real attack gives. His people,
however, will have the satisfaction of knowing that he did his duty
well, bore himself bravely in the face of fire, and died like a
soldier.” Another officer friend. Captain Quinan, writes:—“I well
remember Jim when he left England for France, as full of spirits as old
Allan Richardson before him, who, too, has been killed. Jim was full of
life, and only asked for a chance to help to avenge his chum. He will, I
assure you, always remain in my memory as ‘Jim,’ a very fine and gallant
gentleman.” He was a Presbyterian and a Liberal Conservative. Lieutenant
Blair was very proud of the Canadians, and in a letter to his parents,
said;—“The Canadians have no black marks against them, and do not
intend to have.” He had a high reputation both as an instructor and as a
soldier. One of Lieutenant Blair’s ancestors, Captain William Blair,
fought at the siege of Louisburg in 1745, and his father joined the
militia.

=Bell, Clarence A. H.= (Toronto, Ont.), Clerk in Chambers, Supreme Court
of Ontario, Osgoode Hall, son of Alexander Bell, M.D., whose father,
James B. Bell, was for many years Registrar of the County of Lanark at
Perth. Born at Oshawa, May 3, 1869, removing shortly thereafter to
Lakefield, Co. Peterborough. Educated at Lakefield public school and
Peterborough Collegiate Institute. He married Louise Ella, daughter of
the late John Brown, of Lloydtown, June 24, 1893, and has two children,
Sybil Irene and Arthur Armstrong (formerly a signaller in France). He
entered the Department of Attorney-General under the late Sir Oliver
Mowat, May, 1887, and was transferred to the Central Office, Osgoode
Hall, 1896, receiving the appointment of Clerk in Chambers, June, 1917.
Mr. Bell is an active member of many fraternal societies, being P.C.,
Knights of Pythias; High Chief Ranger, Independent Order of Foresters;
representative on several occasions at the National Fraternal Congress
of America; member of Ionic Lodge, A.F. & A.M. and St. Patrick’s
Chapter; member Royal Arcanum; Chosen Friends; L.O.L. and Preceptory,

Church), being a member of the Executive Committee, Diocese of Toronto;
Dominion President for several years of Anglican Young People’s
Association; Secretary of Diocesan Lay Readers’ Association; President
many years of Progressive Bible Class—at one time one of the largest
Bible classes in Canada. He is publisher of the “Circuit Guide,” a
compendium issued half-yearly for the use of judges and lawyers. To the
average man, the above-mentioned associations would appear almost
sufficient to occupy his spare time; but not so with Mr. Bell, whose
activity seems almost infinite, for he is an enthusiastic student of
astronomy and the history of ancient Egypt, upon both of which subjects
he has given frequent lectures. But the safety-valve of his unusually
active life is probably to be found in the even balance he maintains
between mental, social, and religious pursuits on the one hand, and an
ardent—always ardent and active in everything—love of wild animals,
wild birds, wild flowers, camping, woodmanship and canoeing, at which he
is an expert. All his available holidays are spent near nature’s heart
at his summer house in the northern part of Peterborough County where he
breathes in ozone, puts on tan, relaxes and strengthens his muscles, and
augments his optimism in preparation for the following season of busy
city life. His city residence is 563 Gladstone Avenue.

=Dewart, Herbert Hartley, K.C., M.P.P.= (Toronto), son of the late Rev.
Edward Hartley Dewart, D.D., formerly editor of the Christian Guardian,
and was born in St. John’s, Quebec, November 9, 1861. He received his
education in Toronto at the Model School and Toronto Collegiate,
graduating from the University of Toronto with B.A. degree in 1883. He
was called to the Bar in 1887, and created a K.C., in 1899. He was for
several years examiner in English at the University of Toronto, and was
elected a Senator of the University in 1906. He has been counsel in many
big criminal trials, and was junior counsel with B. B. Osier, K.C., in
the Ford and Hyans murder trials. Later he prosecuted for the Crown,
being appointed Crown Attorney for the County of York in 1891. He held
this position until 1904, when he resigned to engage in general counsel
work. He was engaged in many big trials, both criminal and civil.
Notable among these were the defence of Carrie Davies and McCutcheon
brothers. He was also retained in big inquiries, and as Liberal counsel
at the small arms ammunition inquiry at Ottawa, had interesting passages
with Sir Sam Hughes. He has also written and spoken on law matters.
These are regarded as authoritative, and attracted much attention in
legal circles. Mr. Dewart has been actively interested in politics for
many years, although he has been a member of Parliament but a short
time. Mr. Dewart’s first official connection with the Liberal party was
in 1887, when he was President of the Young Men’s Liberal Club in
Toronto. He held this position also the following year. His first
attempt to get into the active arena as a member of Parliament was in
1904, when he contested South Toronto in the Liberal interest. He was
defeated by A. C. Macdonell (now Senator) by a majority of 409. The next
attempt was in 1911, when he was defeated in Centre York by Tom Wallace,
M.P., but was successful in 1916, when he contested Southwest Toronto
for the Legislature. He was a familiar speaker “on the hustings”
throughout Ontario for years previous, and had taken a keen interest in
Liberal organizations. As a lawyer he is famous throughout Canada, and
has been in some of the biggest cases in the history of the courts.
Success came in the by-election in Southwest Toronto for the Legislature
in 1916. The seat had previously been Conservative by a majority of
about 4,000. Mr. Dewart, running against Mr. James Norris, turned this
into a Liberal majority of over 600. It was the first time in many years
that Toronto had elected a Liberal. Mr. Dewart represents this riding in
the Legislature at present. Since entering the House he has been one of
the foremost in its affairs, and has tackled the Government on many
problems. His speeches on the nickel question have received attention
all over the Dominion. At the big Liberal Convention in Toronto in June,
1919, Mr. Dewart was selected as the Provincial Liberal Leader, by a
most decisive majority, succeeding William Proudfoot, K.C. The new
Liberal Leader is a speaker of logic and grace. His genial personality
has made him many friends. He is also a good debater, as would be
expected after a long and successful legal career. Mr. Dewart is senior
member of the firm of Dewart, Harding, Maw & Hodgson, a Bencher of the
Law Society of Canada, and also a member of the Bar of Manitoba. He
married Emma Smith, daughter of the late H. B. Smith, of Sparta,
Ontario. Mr. Dewart lives at No. 5 Elmesley Place, Toronto, and has a
country place near Uxbridge.

September, 1907. He first married Margaret Coverton, daughter of C. W.
Coverton, M.D., by whom he had two sons and four daughters, the eldest
son being Sir Henry Drayton, K.C., formerly Chief Commissioner of the
Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, and now Minister of Finance
at Ottawa. In 1907, he married Isabel Griffith, daughter of the late W.
E. Griffith, of the Ontario Civil Service, the issue being one daughter,
deceased. For some time he was alderman for old St. Thomas’ Ward, and
for three years chairman of the Board of Health. He was six years
lecturer and examiner of the Ontario Law School. He is a member of the
Sons of England and of St. George’s Society, of which he is a
past-president. His position as official arbitrator is very onerous and
responsible. While at college and in the military, Mr. Drayton was an
ardent devotee of athletics, and won many prizes in different classes of
sport, still retaining his reputation as a crack shot. His recreations
are fishing and shooting. The family reside at 296 St. George Street,

=Fielding, Hon. William Stevens, LL.D., D.C.L., P.C., M.P.=, one of the
leading Liberal statesmen of Canada, was born at Halifax, N.S., November
24, 1848, the son of Charles and Sarah (Ellis) Fielding. He was educated
in the public schools of Halifax, and at the age of sixteen entered the
office of the “Chronicle” of that city as a reporter, and ultimately
became managing editor, a post from which he retired in 1884. He early
developed a rare talent as a public speaker, with a special aptitude for
the handling of financial topics. At the Nova Scotia elections of 1882
he was elected to the Legislature for Halifax County as a Liberal, and
two years later became Premier and Provincial Secretary. He was
successful in carrying his party to victory in the general elections of
1886, 1890 and 1894, gaining an ever-increasing fame as an orator and
administrator. When Sir Wilfrid Laurier, became Prime Minister of
Canada, after the Federal elections of 1896, he induced Mr. Fielding to
leave the provincial arena and become Minister of Finance in his
cabinet. The new Minister was elected to the House of Commons for the
riding of Shelburne and Queens by acclamation on August 2, 1896, and was
re-elected at the general elections of 1900, 1904, and 1908. In 1911, he
was personally defeated in the contest which resulted in the general
defeat of the Laurier administration on the reciprocity issue. The great
historic act of Mr. Fielding’s career as Minister of Finance was his
establishment of an Imperial British trade preference in 1897, which has
since become a permanent factor in Canadian tariff policies, and which
won him fame throughout the Empire. In 1907, he also negotiated a
reciprocity treaty in certain commodities with France; and during the
fifteen years that he was Minister of Finance was a notable figure at
Colonial and Imperial conferences in London. In 1910, he conducted on
behalf of Canada the negotiations with President Taft to avert tariff
war between Canada and the United States, and in the spring of 1911 was
one of the commissioners who negotiated the reciprocity agreement with
the United States, which, in the following September was rejected at the
polls, and which became known as the Knox-Fielding pact. On the defeat
of the Laurier administration, he re-entered journalism as President and
Editor-in-Chief of the “Journal of Commerce,” Montreal. In 1917, he
returned to politics as an Independent Liberal, supporting the Union
Government on the question of conscription, and was elected by
acclamation for his old constituency. At the National Liberal Convention
of August, 1919, his election to the party Leadership was strongly urged
by supporters in all parts of Canada; and despite his reluctance to
accept the honour he was only defeated by the narrow majority of 38 in a
poll at which more than 900 votes were cast. In religion Hon. Mr.
Fielding is a Baptist, and on September 7, 1876, married Hester,
daughter of Thos. A. Rankine, of St. John, N.B., by whom he had four
daughters and one son. He resides at 286 Charlotte Street, Ottawa.

=Foran, Joseph Kearney, K.C., Litt. D., LL.B.=, Montreal and Ottawa, is
one of the legal staff of the House of Commons, and also one of the
leading litterateurs of Canada. He was born at Aylmer, Que., on
September 5, 1857, the son of John Foran, a prominent lumberman, and his
wife, Catharine F. Kearney. The latter was a lady of pronounced literary
talent, and in her younger days was on the staff of the Dublin “Nation.”
After coming to America, she for a time edited the “Ladies’ Literary
Journal,” of Philadelphia. The subject of this sketch was educated at
St. Joseph’s College, now known as Ottawa University, graduating in
1877. He then entered Laval University, Quebec, to equip himself for the

During this three-year term he also obtained practical experience of his
profession in the offices of Andrews, Caron, Andrews and Fitzpatrick, of
which the late Sir Adolphe Caron and Sir Charles Fitzpatrick, formerly
Chief Justice of Canada, were members. From 1880 to 1883, he practised
law at Aylmer, Quebec, but in the latter year ill-health compelled him
to spend three years in the woods of the north. In 1886 he was
sufficiently restored in health to return to civic conditions, and for
two years he acted as secretary to the Speaker of the House of Commons.
He also became active as a writer of poems, essays and other forms of
literary effort which were accepted by numerous Canadian and American
publications, and in 1891 he became editor of the “True Witness,” of
Montreal, which won an honorable place in Catholic journalism by the
literary distinction of its contents and the breadth of its outlook. At
the same time he began to acquire fame as a speaker and lecturer, and
has been heard in many parts of Canada and the United States. His
addresses are marked not only by rare eloquence, but by a spirit of
toleration that makes them acceptable in all assemblages. In 1894, the
University of Ottawa conferred on him the degree of Doctor of Letters,
and his address on that occasion won tributes from the Earl of Aberdeen
and other distinguished men who were present. He also speaks with equal
facility in French and English. He has published a number of volumes,
including “Obligations,” a legal treatise; “Poems and Lyrics”; “Simon
the Abenakis,” a novel; “The Spirit of the Age,” an historical and
philosophical essay; and “Irish Canadian Representatives.” The latter
publication won high tributes from both Sir John A. Macdonald and Sir
Wilfrid Laurier. He is a strong advocate of the cause of Irish freedom
and in 1882 drafted the first Home Rule resolution presented in the
House of Commons, for which the late Hon. John Costigan stood sponsor.
In 1902 he entered the office of the Secretary of the Law Branch of the
House of Commons as English translator; in 1908 he became Assistant Law
Clerk; and in 1912, when the Parliamentary Counselship was created he

of literary culture who has been of great assistance to her husband in
his work. They have two surviving children, Lieut. Herbert P. Foran, a
student of McGill University, and Miss Ethel U. Foran.

=Henry, Hon. George Stewart, M.P.P., B.A., LL.B.=, Minister of
Agriculture for the Province of Ontario, is not only a practical farmer
but an agricultural expert of wide academic training. He was born at
King Township, York County, Ont., on July 16, 1871, the son of William
and Louisa Henry, the mother’s parents being from Ulster, as was also
his father. The subject of this sketch was educated at the public
schools of Toronto, Upper Canada College and the University of Toronto,
of which he holds the degrees of B.A. and LL.B. He also spent a year at
the Ontario Agricultural College, Guelph, Ont., and though equipped for
a professional career decided to adopt the vocation of farmer in East
York, near Toronto. In this field he proved himself extremely
successful, and as a young man took an active part in the public affairs
of his district. He was a member of York Township Council from 1903
until 1910, holding the position of Reeve during the last four years of
that interval. This carried with it membership in the York County
Council, and in 1909 he was elected by his colleagues warden of York, an
old and historic office. A vacancy in the Ontario Legislature for the
riding of East York necessitated a by-election, and he was nominated in
the Conservative interest. He was returned at the head of the poll on
September 8, 1913, and at the general elections of the following June
was again successful. In the spring of 1918, Sir William Hearst, Prime
Minister of Ontario, invited him to enter the Ontario cabinet as
Minister of Agriculture, a portfolio he had himself filled for some
months after the death of the late Hon. James Duff. This necessitated a
by-election in the summer of that year. Mr. Henry was again elected for
East York, for the third time in five years. In that office he has
pursued a vigorous progressive policy, not only with regard to the
development of agriculture in the outlying districts, but in stimulating
production in the older settlements. He has also been a leader in the
Good Roads Movement; he is a member of the Toronto and York Roads
Commission, and is Secretary-Treasurer of the Ontario Good Roads
Association. He was also a prominent figure in the All-Canada Roads
Conference held at Quebec under the Presidency of Sir Lomer Gouin in
May, 1919. In addition to conducting a farm of a model character, Mr.

daughter of Rev. F. W. Pickett, of the Toronto Methodist Conference. He
resides at Todmorden, on the outskirts of Toronto.

elected a Fellow in Political Science at Toronto University, and in that
capacity taught Canadian constitutional history there. On the retirement
of Prof. W. J. Ashley, who had been at the head of the Political Science
Department, he was placed in temporary charge pending the arrival of
Prof. Mavor, the new incumbent from Scotland. He afterward continued as
lecturer under Prof. Mavor for one year. At this period he was a
prolific writer of pamphlets and magazine essays. He is the author of
“The Ontario Township: a History of the Growth of Municipal Institutions
in the Province,” printed under Government auspices as the first of the
Toronto University studies in political science. He also wrote an “Essay
on Currency and Banking,” which was awarded the Ramsay Scholarship and
printed at the request of the leading bankers of Canada. Another essay
of his on “Karl Marx’s Theory of Value” was declared by Prof. Ashley to
be the ablest exposition of the abstract theory of value that it had
been his good fortune to have heard or read on any occasion. At the
invitation of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, he
contributed a series of articles to their publication, “Annals,” upon
subjects of economic and historical importance—to Canadians especially.
On giving up his academic career in the middle nineties he returned to
Middlesex County, and settled down to the practice of law in London,
Ont., where he has ever since resided. As a barrister, he has been
identified with many important cases. He was associated with the late E.
F. B. Johnston, K.C., in the defence of Gerald Sifton, charged with the
murder of his father, which ran through three trials and finally
resulted in the acquittal of the accused. He was also associated with
Mr. Johnston and Mr. W. R. (now Justice) Riddell, K.C., as one of the
counsel for Hon. J. R. Stratton in the Royal Commission to investigate a
charge of attempted bribery, preferred by the late R. R. Gamey, M.P.P.
for Manitoulin. This was a political _cause célèbre_, and resulted in a
victory for the defence. For a quarter of a century, Mr. McEvoy has been
intimately associated with the fortunes of the Liberal party in his
district. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the House of Commons in
East Middlesex in the general elections of 1904, and for London in the
general elections of 1911. At the Ontario elections of 1908 he also
contested the London seat against Sir Adam Beck, but was defeated. Mr.
McEvoy is a strong advocate of the tariff-for-revenue-only principle and
of an Anglo-Saxon alliance, and is a member of the Ontario Club,
Toronto, a headquarters of Liberalism. In 1894 he married a daughter of
John Anderson, of East Williams, Ont. He has one son, Captain A. M.
McEvoy, of the C.E.F., and one daughter, Miss Gladys, at home.

=Chambers, Col. Ernest John.= Col. Ernest John Chambers, Gentleman Usher
of the Black Rod, was appointed to that position March 1st, 1904. He is
the son of Edward Thomas and Louisa Percy (Davies) Chambers and was born
in Penkridge, Staffordshire, England, April 16th, 1862, coming to Canada
in 1870. He was educated at the Prince Albert School, St. Henri, Quebec,
and the Montreal High School. Col. Chambers belongs to the same family
as Captain Chambers, R.N., who commanded the flotilla on Lake Champlain
during the Revolutionary War with the now United States of America.
Captain Chambers, afterwards Admiral, served as a midshipman under
Captain Cook at the great siege and taking of Quebec. Another of the
same family was an officer in the British Army, took part in most of the
fighting in the Niagara Peninsula, 1812-13, and was taken prisoner.
When, February 3, 1916, fire destroyed the Parliament Buildings at
Ottawa, the Black Rod, the emblem of authority carried by the Gentleman
Usher of the Black Rod, was burnt, and Col. Chambers was ordered to
procure a new one. The new emblem, which was subscribed for by the
members of the United Kingdom Branch of the Empire Parliamentary
Association, is similar to the Black Rods of the House of Lords and the
Senates of Australia and South Africa, is made of ebony with the “Lyon”
crest, butt piece and knob of solid gold, and bears wreaths of maple
leaves. The shield is engraved with the royal monogram, and the butt
piece contains a sovereign of the year 1904, when Col. Chambers was
appointed, and the coin is to pass to his family as an heirloom. In 1885
Col. Chambers acted as field correspondent for the “Montreal Star”
during the Riel insurrection, and served as a volunteer galloper to
General Middleton at Batoche and Fish Creek, and wears the medal and
clasp, the Long Service Medal, and the Colonial Auxiliary Forces
Officers’ Decoration. He participated in the operations against Big
Bear’s band of Indians. In 1888-9 Col. Chambers was Managing-Director
and Editor of the “Calgary Herald,” and for two years was joint
proprietor and editor of the Canadian “Military Gazette.” Since 1912
Col. Chambers has been Secretary of the Canadian Branch Empire
Parliamentary Association. Since 1908 he has been editor of the Canadian
Parliamentary Guide. He has done good work in the field of Literature
and is the historian of several of our most distinguished Canadian
Regiments. In fact he has been a prominent and clever contributor to a
variety of publications on Parliamentary, historical, military, hunting
and yachting subjects. He is the author of many books on historical and
military subjects. He was connected with the Canadian Militia for many
years. When but a boy Col. Chambers commanded the Montreal High School
Cadet Rifles. Later, in 1902, he became Captain and Adjutant of the 6th
Fusiliers, Montreal, now the Grenadier Guards of Canada. In 1910 he was
appointed District Intelligence Officer, Montreal, with the rank of
Captain in the Corps of Guides and was promoted to Major in 1911,
Lieut.-Col. in 1915, Colonel in 1917. In August, 1914, at the outbreak
of the great war, Col. Chambers was appointed Censor at the Military
Headquarters in Ottawa, and July 15th, 1915, Chief Press Censor for
Canada, and continued to perform his duties as such. In the discharge of
his duties he proved an ideal officer, and his name was brought to the
attention of the Secretary of State for War for distinguished service.
August 31, 1898, Col. Chambers married Bertha Macmillan, of Kingston,
Ontario. He has one son and one daughter. He is a member of the Royal
Ottawa Golf, the Rivermead Golf and the Coulonge Fish and Game Clubs.
For recreation he indulges in shooting, fishing, yachting, and golf. He
resides at 325 Daly Ave., Ottawa, Ontario.

=Hogg, William Drummond, K.C.=, barrister-at-law, Ottawa, is one of the
most distinguished figures in Canadian legal circles. He was born at
Perth, Lanark County, Ont., on February 29, 1848, the son of David Hogg,
a prominent furniture manufacturer of that town. His father was a son of
Lieut. David Hogg, of Edinburgh, Scotland, who became an officer of the
Royal Artillery, and in that capacity took part in the siege of
Copenhagen, and was present at the Battle of the Pyramids, the Battle of
the Nile, and other historic engagements of the Napoleonic wars. James
Hogg, the Scottish poet and the “Ettrick Shepherd” of “Noctes
Ambrosianæ,” was a relative. David Hogg (who died in 1882) came to
Canada just fifty years previously and became one of the pioneer
settlers of Lanark County, where, at the village of Perth, he
established the industry above-mentioned. The mother of the subject of
this sketch, Isabella Inglis, was a native of Clackmannan, Scotland, who
came to Canada in 1831 and settled with relatives in Lanark village.
These relatives were the Hall family, with branches in many parts of
Upper Canada, and whose name is identified with the early history of
such towns and cities as Peterboro, Sarnia, Brockville, and Perth. She
died in 1881. Mr. Hogg was educated at the High School, Perth, Ont., and
commenced the study of law in the office of E. G. Malloch, Crown
Attorney for Lanark County. Subsequently, he spent several years in the
offices of Paterson, Bain & Paterson, Toronto, and was called to the
Ontario Bar at Hilary term, 1874. He commenced practice at Ottawa in
1875 in partnership with the late Daniel O’Connor. For some years after
the death of the latter he practised alone, but on the admission of his
son to the Bar the firm became Hogg & Hogg. The practice of Mr. Hogg has
largely lain in the Supreme and Exchequer Courts of Canada, and he is a
recognized authority on questions of prerogative and constitutional law.
Though a Conservative in party leanings, he has never sought political
office, and one of the convincing proofs of his professional standing is
the fact that during the Liberal _régime_ of Sir Wilfrid Laurier his
services were frequently sought in connection with important and
intricate Government litigation. He is a member of St. Andrews Society
of Ottawa, and was for many years solicitor of that body. He has also
had the honour of being elected by his fellow barristers a Bencher of
the Law Society of Upper Canada and is now a life Bencher of that
Society, and was some years ago created King’s Counsel. When the late
James Bethune, K.C., of Toronto, a relative by marriage, passed away, a
long friendship of the most intimate personal, and professional
character was severed. Mr. Hogg holds very strong views on the subject
of temperance, and at various times held all the executive offices of
the Sons of Temperance. He married Louisa Agnes, daughter of Dr. Charles
Rattray, of Cornwall, Ont., and has two sons. His business address is
the Trust Building, Ottawa.

=Gwynne, Brigadier-General Reginald John, C.M.G.=,
Deputy-Adjutant-General for Canada, Headquarters Staff, Ottawa, is a
native of the motherland, but has been intimately identified with the
marvellous development of Canada’s military power during the past few
years. He was born in London, England, on September 16, 1863, the son of
the late J. E. A. Gwynne, J.P., F.S.A., F.R.S., etc., of Folkington
Manor, Polegate, Sussex, England, and his wife, Mary Earle Purvis. He
was educated at Cheam, Eton, and Pembroke College, Oxford. After coming
to Canada, he became identified with the Active Militia of this country,
and commanded the 16th Horse, a Western organization, from 1907 to 1911.
In 1911 and 1912, he was in command of the 7th Cavalry Brigade, and in
1913 he was appointed to the Headquarters Staff at Ottawa as Director of
Cadet Services for the Dominion. In 1914, the year of the outbreak of
the great war, he became Director of Mobilization, with the rank of
Brevet-Colonel and in that capacity performed very important services in
connection with the organization of Canada’s overseas forces. In 1916,
he was promoted to the rank of Director-General of Mobilization, a post
he filled until the close of the war, and in the following year raised
to the rank of Brigadier-General. In 1919 he was appointed
Deputy-Adjutant-General for Canada. In recognition of his services he
was created by His Majesty a Companion of the Most Distinguished Order
of St. Michael and St. George. On May 16, 1894, he married Mary Mayall,
daughter of S. Taylor, J.P., and Janet Mayall Taylor, of Hathershaw,
Oldham, England, and has one daughter, Evelyn Violet. In religion he is
an adherent of the Church of England, and he is a member of the Rideau
Club, Ottawa.

=King, Hon. William Lyon Mackenzie, C.M.G.= (Ottawa, Ont.), Leader of
the Liberal Party of Canada, was born at Berlin (now Kitchener), Ont.,
on December 17, 1874, the son of John King, K.C., and his wife, Isabel
Grace, daughter of William Lyon Mackenzie. He was educated at Toronto
University (B.A. 1895; LL.B. 1896; M.A. 1897), the University of
Chicago, and Harvard University (A.M. 1898; Ph.D. 1909). He was one of
the first Canadian students to specialize in social science. For a time
he was a reporter on various Toronto newspapers. In 1900, when Sir
William Mulock, then Postmaster-General in the Laurier Cabinet,
established the Federal Department of Labour, Mr. King was chosen as
Deputy-Minister to organize it. In 1908, he was elected to the House of
Commons for the riding of North Waterloo, and subsequently was promoted
by Sir Wilfrid Laurier to the post of Minister of Labour. He was
defeated, in company with the majority of Liberal candidates, in the
Federal elections in 1911. During his years of service in the Labour
Department, Mr. King was responsible for much important permanent
legislation with regard to industrial disputes, immigration, and the
opium traffic, and served on numerous Royal Commissions on matters
pertaining to Labour and to the problem of Oriental Immigration. On
different occasions, he represented Canada on important missions to
England. In 1909, he was appointed by the Imperial Government one of the
British representatives on the Anti-Opium Commission, which met at
Shanghai, China. In June of 1914, he was appointed Director of an
Investigation of Industrial Relations under the auspices of the
Rockefeller Foundation. In this position, he was instrumental in
bringing about better relations between employers and employees in the
coal mines of Colorado, where for years there had been serious
industrial strife. Throughout the period of the War, he rendered a like
service to several other of the largest industries in America engaged in
the production of war necessities. His researches were subsequently
incorporated in a volume entitled “Industry and Humanity,” which has
obtained international recognition as one of the most searching and
advanced considerations of an all-important question. Mr. King has
always maintained his connection with the Canadian Liberal Party. From
1911 to 1914, he was President of the Ontario Reform Association. In
December, 1917, he was the Liberal candidate in North York. At the
National Liberal Convention, held in Ottawa, August, 1919, he was
elected Leader of the Liberal Party in succession to the late Sir
Wilfrid Laurier. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, and a
member of the following clubs—Rideau (Ottawa), Ontario (Toronto),
Century (New York), Harvard (Boston and New York). He is a Presbyterian
in religion and unmarried.

=Hanna (the late), Hon. William John, K.C., M.P.P.= (Sarnia Ont.), was
born in Adelaide township, County of Middlesex, Ont., on October 13,
1862, the son of George and Jane (Murdock) Hanna. The son of a farmer,
he was educated at the local schools and soon developed great capacity
as a student, and decided to put himself through for the legal
profession, graduating from Osgoode Hall, Toronto. He was called to the
Bar in 1890, and commenced the practice of law as a barrister at Sarnia,
Ont., eventually becoming head of the firm of H. Le Sueur and McKinley
of that place, and was created a K.C. in 1908. He soon became active
with the Conservative party, and in 1896 became the candidate of that
party for the House of Commons in West Lambton against the late Justice
Lister, and was defeated. His party still had confidence in him, and in
1900 he was again nominated for the Federal House and again defeated,
West Lambton always having been a great Liberal stronghold. Two years
later, in 1902, Mr. Whitney, then leader of the Opposition in Ontario,
in looking for a strong man to help him in Western Ontario, prevailed
upon Mr. Hanna to run for the Provincial Legislature and undertake the
work of organizing Western Ontario. He accepted, made an amazing
turnover in that portion of the Liberal stamping grounds, was elected,
and came to Toronto in 1905. When the Conservative government came into
power, Mr. Whitney invited him to become one of his cabinet, and he
chose the portfolio of Provincial Secretary, as in this position his
duties would neither come in contact or conflict with the position he
held as chief legal adviser to the largest oil corporation in Canada.
His public life was free from reproach of mixing up private interests
and friendships with his public duties, and as a legal practitioner an
extraordinary fact is recorded of him: that while representing one of
the most important corporations in the country, no case he had to handle
ever went into court; he had a singular and commendable theory that it
was the duty of a lawyer to keep his clients out of court. He was
elected again to the Ontario Legislature in 1908 and 1911, and appointed
a member of the Inter-Provincial Conference held at Ottawa in 1910. His
desire for a rest and to complete his great work in connection with his
pet hobby of prison reform led him to decline a portfolio when the
Hearst government was formed, although he remained in the cabinet as
minister without portfolio; and in connection with his services as a
public servant in Ontario, it may be said that, though not a
prohibitionist by conviction, he was the most efficient administrator of
the liquor license system that this country has ever known. He created
the machinery for the administration of the prohibition law, which has
proved as effective as was possible. His natural taste for politics did
not die out on his retirement from office, and he became one of Sir
Robert Borden’s most trusted private advisers on public policy. He
perfected a system of prison reform which, perhaps, is the most sensible
and humane prison system in the world; in fact, his ten years or more of
service given to the Province of Ontario as administrator of its public
charities, its license laws, its prisons, asylums, and other
institutions, constitute a record so progressive and enlightened that
the full value of his services will long continue to be recognized by
sociologists with a habit for research. In 1917, Sir Robert Borden
induced him to accept the post of Food Controller of Canada; and Mr.
Hanna at once applied himself to the task of organizing that department,
making his single aim the increase of production and the conserving of
foodstuffs in order to ensure a steady supply to the soldiers in the
field and the civilian populations of Britain, France and Italy. He
encountered great difficulties owing to the misapprehension of the
public, which demanded a reduction of prices, a measure that, by
increasing consumption, would have defeated the above-named object. He
however, refused to be moved by popular clamor, and in co-operation with
Mr. H. H. Hoover rendered great service toward relieving the overseas
populations of the danger of starvation. His exertions told on his
physique, and early in 1918 he resigned this office, leaving it well
organized for his successor. On the retirement of Mr. Walter C. Teagle
from the post of President of the Imperial Oil Company to become
President of the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, Mr. Hanna was
elected his successor. In that capacity, he, in December, 1918,
introduced the Industrial Relationship plan in all the plants of the
Company from coast to coast, and also a series of sickness, death and
insurance benefits for workmen. Grief at the death of his only son,
Flight-Lieutenant Neil Hanna, who was killed by accident in Italy in
November, 1918, a few days after the signing of the armistice,
undermined his health, and on March 20, 1919, he died suddenly while on
a vacation in Georgia. When he was borne to his last resting-place at
Sarnia, his funeral was attended by public men from all parts of Canada
and many sections of the United States. The late Mr. Hanna was twice
married: first to Jean J. Neil, who died in 1891, leaving one son, the
late Neil Hanna; and secondly to Maud McAdams, by whom he had two
daughters. In religion he was a Methodist, and a member of many
important clubs and philanthropic organizations.

=Gale, Robert Henry=, one of the leading public men of Vancouver, of
which city he has been a resident for nearly a decade, is a native of
the city of Quebec. After an excellent business training in the ancient
capital of Canada, he went to British Columbia in 1910, and located at
Vancouver. He engaged in business as a contractor, and is at present
manager of the British Columbia Contractor’s Supply Company, Limited,
one of the largest enterprises of its kind in the province. Less than
five years ago he entered municipal politics, and was elected alderman
for 1916 and 1917. His services during his comparatively brief term on
the City Council made him so widely popular that his friends urged him
to run for Mayor in 1918. He accepted the nomination, and in January of
that year was elected over the retiring mayor, Mr. Malcolm McBeath, who
had sought re-election, by a majority of 300, the largest ever given to
a mayoralty aspirant in the history of Vancouver. In January, 1919, he
was re-elected by acclamation, it being generally conceded that it would
be futile for any rival to contest the office with him. In April of
1919, the provincial government of which Hon. John Oliver is the head
appointed him to the newly-created office of Public Utilities
Commissioner for British Columbia. By the tax-paying public, the
appointment was considered an admirable one, because of the high
capacity Mr. Gale had revealed as a municipal administrator. The Great
War Veterans’ Association, however, made a vigorous protest on the
ground that all new offices within the gift of the government should go
to returned soldiers. The Oliver administration deemed it necessary to
yield to the agitation, and cancelled the appointment of Mr. Gale,
accepting the nominee of the G.W.V.A., Lieutenant-Colonel Retallick, a
civil engineer by profession, who had rendered excellent service
overseas. Under the circumstances, the cancellation of the appointment
was in no sense a reflection on the character or capacity of Mr. Gale.
In politics the latter is a Liberal, but has never sought election as a
political candidate. During the general strike that was started in
Vancouver during the early summer of 1919 as an outgrowth of a general
strike at Winnipeg and other Western towns, Mr. Gale showed great tact
and firmness in handling a very difficult situation, so that the attempt
to disorganize municipal government and upset the present economic
system was of comparatively brief duration.

=Elson, John Melbourne= (St. Catharines, Ont.), was born in Byron, Ont.,
Dec. 25th, 1880. Son of George and Charlotte (Wilkin) Elson. Educated at
London, Ont., Collegiate Institute and Western University of that city.
He entered journalism in 1903 as a member of the staff of the London
“News,” since merged, and thereafter his rise was rapid. Shortly joined
the staff of the Montreal “Gazette” and in 1905 during the late Joseph
Chamberlain’s Tariff Reform Campaign he went to Great Britain to study
political and economic conditions and wrote special articles thereon to
Canadian papers. On his return to Canada he became a member of the staff

has travelled considerably on this continent and abroad, and is a gifted
public speaker. When acting as a newspaper correspondent he secured the
only interview granted by Baron Komura, the Japanese plenipotentiary,
who negotiated the peace treaty between Japan and Russia at Portsmouth,
New Hampshire, except the official statement given to the Associated
Press in the United States. Since becoming a resident of St. Catharines,
he has been active in public affairs, and in patriotic objects like the
Red Cross and the Canadian Patriotic Fund. He was elected Mayor of St.
Catharines, Jan. 1st, 1919, by an unusually large majority. He is a
member of the Council of the Board of Trade; and has served as President
of the St. Catharines Canadian Club, and was for seven years President
of the Lincoln County Liberal Association. He was formerly
Vice-President of the Niagara District Hydro Radial Union, and has been
an active member of Soldiers’ Aid Commission ever since it was organized

Masonic Order. In 1911 he published a brochure, “Reciprocity, The
Outcome of Evolution” which had a wide circulation in Canada and the
United States. For two years he was a member of the Collegiate Institute
Board. Was made member of the Advisory Council of the Repatriation
Committee of the Dominion of Canada. In religion he is an Anglican and
in September, 1907, married Wilhelmina M., daughter of W. M. Faulds of

=Gill, Robert=, of Ottawa, a gentleman well known to the seniors of
Canadian finance, is one of the best known citizens of the Canadian
capital, where he has resided since 1876. He has been especially
identified with the history of the Canadian Bank of Commerce, of which
institution he was a trusted officer for over forty years. He was born
at Dundas, Ont., on September 30, 1851, the son of William and Alison
(Sanderson) Gill, both his parents being of Scottish Border origin. He
was educated at Upper Canada College, Toronto, and entered the service
of the Bank of Commerce at the age of nineteen. This was in 1870, and
the Bank was but three years old. In its expansion during the next few
years Mr. Gill actively participated; his promotions were rapid, and in
1874 he was appointed manager of the Galt, Ont., branch. In 1876 he was
transferred to the Ottawa branch, which was regarded as one of the most
important in the Bank of Commerce chain of agencies. In 1880 he was
appointed an Inspector of the Bank and retained that position until 1887
when he was appointed Manager of the Ottawa branch, which had attained a
very important position in the financial life of the capital. Under his
regime it attained a wide expansion of business and he continued to
direct its affairs until 1911, when he retired on pension after
forty-one years’ service. During his career with the Bank of Commerce he
proved himself not only a practical banker with a complete understanding
of the needs of the business community, but an able thinker and essayist
on financial questions. Among his publications was one on the subject of
Post Office Savings Banks reprinted in the “Canadian Banker’s Journal”
for the use of the United States Currency Commission. Since his
retirement from active business he has lent his services and influence
to the promotion of patriotic and other objects of public welfare, and
during the late war was Vice-President of the Executive of the Ottawa
branch of the Canadian Patriotic Fund. He is also a Life Governor and
Vice-President of St. Luke’s Hospital in that city, and in June, 1916,
was appointed a member of the Military Hospitals Commission. From 1899
to 1906 he was honorary captain and paymaster of the Governor-General’s
Foot Guards. He is a prominent figure in the social life of his chosen
city, and in 1914 was elected President of the Rideau Club of Ottawa, a
position he still holds at the time of writing. He is also a member of
the following other clubs: Country (Ottawa), St. James (Montreal), York
(Toronto), Ottawa Golf, R.C.Y.C. (Toronto) and the Constitutional
(London, Eng.). He is a Past President of the Ottawa Literary and
Scientific Society, member of St. Andrew’s Society (Ottawa), the Royal
Canadian Institute and the Archæological Society of America, and a life
member of the Royal Colonial Institute (England). His recreations are
golf and angling; in religion he is an Anglican and in politics, a
Conservative. Mr. Gill was first married on September 20, 1881, to
Caroline, daughter of John Gilmour of “Marchmont,” Ottawa, by whom he
has one surviving son, Major Allan Gilmour Gill, who during the late war
commanded the 45th Battery, Canadian Field Artillery, overseas. This
lady passed away on April 19, 1884, and Mr. Gill married again on
November 20, 1899, Anna Louise, daughter of the late W. R. Thistle, by
whom he has three sons, Henry Robert Thistle, Evan William Thistle and
Francis Egan Thistle. His permanent residence is at 281 O’Connor Street,
Ottawa, and he has a summer residence, “Gillcairn,” at St. Andrew’s,
N.B.

=Wright, Alexander Whyte=, late Vice-Chairman Workmen’s Compensation
Commission of Ontario, was born in the township of Markham, York County,
Ontario, December 17, 1847, the son of George and Helen (Whyte) Wright,
who came to Canada from Glasgow, Scotland, some years previously. He was
educated in the public schools of New Hamburg, and after a short time in
a drug store, learned the woollen business, later engaging in the
woollen manufacturing business at Linwood, Waterloo County, and
subsequently in Preston, St. Jacobs and Guelph. At an early age he
joined the 29th Battalion, and responded to the call to arms for the
Fenian raid. When the first Riel rebellion broke out he joined the Red
River Expedition under General Sir Garnet Wolseley (afterwards British
Commander-in-Chief Earl Wolseley), serving as a sergeant. On returning
he rejoined the 29th Battalion as sergeant-major. In his later teens and
early twenties he had quite a local reputation as a fine lacrosse player
and fast runner. He had always been a great reader and taken an interest
in politics, and in 1873 left the woollen business to become a reporter
on the Guelph “Herald,” soon after being engaged as editor of the
Orangeville “Sun.” He next edited the Stratford “Herald,” then the
Guelph “Herald.” In 1878 he came to Toronto as editor and joint
publisher of “The National,” making it an ardent advocate of the
national policy, which the late Sir John A. Macdonald had adopted as his
platform after having been urgently pressed to do so by a deputation
consisting of the late Hon. Isaac Buchannan of Hamilton the late William
Wallace, M.P. for Simcoe, the late John Maclean (father of W. F.
Maclean, M.P. of the “World”), the late Thomas Cowan of Galt, the late
W. H. Fraser and Mr. Wright. During the election campaign, he wrote many
articles in the “National” that were extensively quoted by the
Conservative press. Shortly after his return to power, Sir John A.
Macdonald wrote Mr. Wright a letter in his own hand, in which he
said:—“I wish to thank you most sincerely for your splendid work in the
campaign which has just ended so satisfactorily. Your speeches and
writings did more, I believe, than anything else to convert the people
to protection. I only had the good fortune to hear you once—in the
amphitheatre—but I was then struck with your wonderful grasp of the
question and the extraordinary fund of information you possessed, and no
less struck with the admirable way in which you marshalled your facts
and presented your arguments. I hope to be able to express my gratitude
to you in a more substantial way, and will be delighted if you will give
me an opportunity to do so.” Mr. Wright returned to Guelph in 1879 as
editor and joint publisher of the “Herald.” The proposed Government
agreement for the building of the Canadian Pacific Railway did not meet
with Mr. Wright’s approval, and, as the “Herald” had always been a
Conservative paper, he gave up his interest in it, and wrote a series of
articles published in the “Mercury,” advocating its being built and
owned by the Government and paid for by a national currency—not notes
or promises to pay, but bills of different denominations, reading “Legal
tender for all debts, public and private.” He called a meeting to
explain his plan in Guelph city hall, which was packed. At the
conclusion of his address he moved a resolution calling on the
Government to adopt the plan. On sitting down, the late Mr. Donald
Guthrie—father of Hon. Hugh Guthrie, and at that time member of the
legislature—arose and said that he had attended for the purpose of
opposing the scheme, but Mr. Wright’s explanation had so clearly
demonstrated its feasibility and incalculable value that he was
converted to it, and had much pleasure in seconding the resolution. On
those in favour being asked to raise their hands, the audience, with the
exception of one man, rose to their feet and cheered for several
minutes. In thanking the audience for their almost unanimous endorsation
of this plan, Mr. Wright declared that the one exception was an
unlooked-for further compliment. For his independent thought and action
the “Mail” undertook to read Mr. Wright “out of the party.” Sir John A.
Macdonald wrote Mr. Wright, repudiating its assumed authority,
recognized his right to personal opinion, good standing as a
Conservative, and assured him of his personal friendship, and continuing
said: “I have read a report of your speech at Guelph, and, while I am
sorry you saw occasion to make it, I confess I was struck with the plan
you outline for the building of the railway. Possibly, under different
conditions it might be practicable, but do not think it could be carried
out now.” His ideas, however, were over a generation in advance of the
people’s desire for public ownership, and, as a consequence private
capitalists draw some $40,000,000 in bond interest and dividends yearly,
besides adding large sums to reserve, which the people pay; while the
people are out a huge land and money bonus, have neither the national
railway nor a national currency, but instead a huge octopus of
capitalists that dominates our legislation and is an ever-watchful and
valiant defender of “vested rights”—whether rightly or wrongly
obtained. Mr. Wright was invited to speak at the convention of the U.S.
Greenbackers in Chicago in 1880, and accepted, as well as during the
subsequent campaign. He returned to Toronto in 1881, and became
editorial writer on the “World.” The following year he became Secretary
of the Canadian Manufacturers Association, continuing till 1886, when,
owing to the lines of cleavage between capital and labor becoming
marked, he resigned and established the “Labor Reformer,” the first
paper in Canada to advocate public ownership and a workmen’s
compensation act. While secretary of the Canadian Manufacturers
Association he drafted a factory act which he urged the Dominion
Government to pass, providing equal protection and conditions to the
workers in all provinces, as well as for manufacturers against unequal
labor conditions. This the Government failed to adopt. The draft,
however, was made the basis of the Factory Act passed by the Ontario
Government shortly after; but this, of course, could give no protection
to the Ontario manufacturer (and indirectly to the workers as well)
against the longer hours and lower labor conditions obtaining in the
Province of Quebec. In 1886, he was appointed Dominion Government agent
for the Antwerp and the Indian and Colonial Exhibitions, and acted as
one of four commissioners representing Canada in London at the latter.
In 1887, he represented Toronto District Assembly at the General
Assembly of the Knights of Labor, and was the first Canadian elected
member of the General Executive Board, and immediately after was
appointed editor of the “Journal of the Knights of Labor,” Philadelphia,
official organ of the order, continuing to hold both positions till
1892, when he removed to New York as editor of “The Craftsman.” In 1896,
he was appointed by the Laurier Government special commissioner to
investigate and report on the sweating system in Canada, and was
subsequently asked by that Government to investigate and report on the
Japanese difficulties in British Columbia, but was unable to accept.
From 1898 to 1904, he was organizer of the Conservative party in
Ontario, engaging in three campaigns, being in charge of the campaign
that resulted in Sir James Whitney becoming Premier. For a number of
years he was president of the Canadian Public Ownership League, which
did valuable work in educating the public as to the advantages of the
idea now so firmly rooted in the Province of Ontario. He was a candidate
for the Ontario Legislature in West Toronto, on the public ownership
platform in 1908, but was defeated in the three-cornered contest. In
1910-11, he spent about eight months in Britain writing and speaking in
the interest of Imperial preferential trade. On the Ontario Government
in 1914 constituting a commission to put in operation the Workmen’s
Compensation Act, Mr. Wright was appointed Vice-Chairman of the Board,
his appointment said to be the last in which Sir James Whitney took any
personal interest. The appointment met with the unanimous approval of
organized labor. During the recruiting campaign, Mr. Wright took a very
active and effective part in speaking throughout the city and elsewhere.
He married, January 26, 1876, Elizabeth R., eldest daughter of the late
Robert Simpson, at that time of Guelph, but formerly and latterly of
Toronto. Mrs. Wright died in 1913. He is survived by his daughter, Mrs.
W. E. Hunter of Toronto, a grandson and granddaughter, and a brother,
Daniel W., of Cashmere, Washington, U.S. For some time he had been
troubled with blood pressure and in September, 1918, sustained a slight
stroke at his place in Niagara-on-the-Lake, where he delighted in birds,
flowers, and fruit, in the cultivation of which he was well versed. In
April he had a severe attack of neuritis, which, together with heart
trouble, resulted in his death, June 12, 1919, at his home, 105
Macdonnell Avenue, Toronto. Of him, Dr. James L. Hughes wrote: “A. W.
Wright was a vitally progressive force in Canada for half a century. He
was a true democrat who recognized the right of women as well as men to
freedom. Few men of his time so fully represented and so powerfully
expressed justice and consideration for others as the basis of
brotherhood. He was a charming comrade, a faithful friend, and an
eloquent orator. All who knew him were better for his influence. No man
could think a mean or base thought in his presence.” In a touching
letter to Mrs. Hunter from Washington, D.C., T. V. Powderly, formerly
General Master Workman of the Knights of Labor, wrote, in answer to a
notification of Mr. Wright’s death:—“It was withheld from me until this
morning; for a good reason, I suppose. . . . Anyway, I want to remember
your father as I last saw him at my home here four years ago. His going
was a blow to you and all his friends. He drew his sunshine from no
niggard store, and spread more of it across life’s dark pathway than any
man I ever met. His picture, framed, had a vase of Marie Pavia roses
before it this morning. I understood—for your father gave that rosebush
to me thirty years ago, and when we moved here from Scranton in 1899 we
took it with us; we call it Marie Pavia Wright. I have known your father
for forty years, and though for part of that time we were officially
associated in the K. of L., our friendship was confined within no
official band. . . . For years I had a dream. It was that some day I
could so manage as to live close to your father and John Devlin. D. died
a year ago. Perhaps we may live together yet—who knows? Soon I shall
take up the journey they have begun, and when that hour comes I hope it
may be said of me as I now say of your father:—

        “Out through the portals of death he passed
        To that ultimate, Unknown land;
        The chart of right and of deeds well done,
        Held in his cold, dead hand.
        For the words he traced to his latest breath
        Are unclouded by wrong or ruth;
        And stamped on all, as he met his death,
        Was the seal of love and truth.”

Writing in the “World,” W. F. Maclean, M.P., said “The late A. W. Wright
was an able man who played a leading part in making the destiny of
Canada. . . . He had wit, a beaming way, and a radiant kind of
sociability.” The “Hamilton Herald” said:—“Few Canadians of the last
generation contributed more to the upbuilding of Canada than A. W.
Wright. Much of the success of the Workmen’s Compensation Act is due to
his sagacity and clear, swift insight. As a newspaper writer Alex.
Wright was one of the most forceful of his time. As a platform speaker,
when dealing with a subject with which he was familiar, he was
unsurpassed. He had bright, incisive style and a talent for keen
analysis. He was at his best when heckled. He courted interruption, for
no one could get the better of him in a clash of wits.” In a review of
his career, “Saturday Night” spoke of him as “a man of remarkable
intellectual powers and charming personality,” and of his youth, “he
made a hobby of economics and by the time he was thirty was recognized
as one of the ablest writers and speakers on such subjects in this
country.” When nickel was discovered in Ontario he urged on the
government to establish a customs smelter to treat it, to sell at cost
to actual users of it in Canada, and to place a heavy export duty on it,
thereby giving Canadians a great advantage in manufacturing high-grade
machinery of nickel steel, thus greatly stimulating industry here, and
assuring Canada millions of dollars annually from export duty on nickel
which outsiders must have at any cost. Instead of this a foreign concern
was given a practical monopoly to refine Canadian nickel in the U.S.
with the right to sell to Germany or any other enemy of Canada and the
empire. Both as writer and speaker he was keenly analytical, logical,
and constructive in his chosen style, but in dealing with an unfair
opponent he was equally at home in using forceful denunciation, bitter
irony, scorching sarcasm, or ludicrous burlesque, while in flashing and
apt repartee he was unrivalled. He was widely read in prose and poetry,
and, possessing a remarkable memory and facile power of expression, was
a charming conversationalist, usually the centre of a group of
appreciative auditors in any informal gathering. As raconteur he was
inimitable. Continual optimism, constant cheerfulness, and unvarying
kindliness were his outstanding characteristics, and won for him the
friendship of all who knew him.

=Whitney, Edwin Canfield= (Ottawa, Ont.), one of the leading capitalists
of that city, and especially identified with the Canadian lumbering
industry. He was born at Williamsburg, Ont., in the St. Lawrence Valley,
on October 29, 1844, the son of Richard Leet and Clarissa Jane (Fairman)
Whitney. The Whitney family is of United Empire Loyalist stock and
descended from Henry Whitney, who came to New England from
Herefordshire, England, in 1640. The late Sir James Whitney, Prime
Minister of Ontario from 1905 to 1914 was an elder brother of the
subject of this sketch. Edwin Canfield Whitney was educated at the
public schools of his district, and subsequently moved to Minneapolis,
Minn., where he engaged in the lumbering industry, and in the course of
years built up a substantial fortune. He later removed to Ottawa, where
he engaged in the lumber business as General Manager of the St. Anthony
Lumber Company, Ltd., until 1912, when he retired from active business
with the winding up of the company. He is also Vice-President of the
Crow’s Nest Pass Coal Company. He was also one of the directors of the
Keewatin Flour Mills Company, Ltd. He is a Director of the Bank of
Ottawa and of the Toronto General Trusts Company, Ltd. The
philanthropies of Mr. Whitney have been of a most enlightened character.
He is one of the Governors of Protestant General Hospital, Ottawa, and
in 1905 erected at an expense of $68,000 and presented to the University
of Toronto a residence for male students. In the same year he was
appointed a Trustee of the University Residence Fund, and in 1906 became
one of the Governors of the University proper. Among his other gifts to
the institution have been a valuable collection of works on Egypt and
its antiquities, now in the University library. In 1911, he made a
standing offer of $30,000 toward the erection of a general hospital in
Ottawa, if the balance of the required sum could be raised. The
good-heartedness and generosity of Mr. Whitney in connection with
charities is indeed proverbial with all who know him, and during the
great war his gifts to patriotic and other funds were on a generous
scale. In association with Mrs. Whitney, he gave $5,000 to Trinity
University (of which his brother, Sir James Whitney, was a distinguished
graduate), and also a memorial church to the Anglican parish of
Williamsburg, Ont., of which he was a member when a boy. Mr. Whitney is
an adherent of the Anglican communion, and has on many occasions been a
delegate to the Synods of that church. In March, 1879, he married Sarah,
widow of the late Glossop McQuire, C.E., and daughter of the late J. P.
Chrysler, M.P.P. Mrs. Whitney is also interested in philanthropic
effort, and has been especially active in the Ottawa Humane Society. In
politics Mr. Whitney is an independent. He is a member of the Masonic
order and of the Country and Hunt Clubs, Ottawa.

growers, re-cleaners and exporters of those commodities. Mr. Vaughan has
also taken an active part in the municipal affairs of Welland. He had
the honour of being elected Mayor of that municipality for 1917, the
year in which it achieved the status of a city, and on July 1, of that
year presided over the inauguration proceedings in connection with that
happy event. He also filled the office of Mayor for the year 1918,

=Wylie, Newton= (Toronto, Ont.), Journalist and Student of and Lecturer
on Social and Political Economy and Affairs, son of John H. Wylie and
Mary Jane Bernhardt, was born on September 12, 1892, at Toronto, and
received his education at the Orangeville High School, Calgary Normal
School, University of Toronto and Harvard University, graduating in
1917. When but a boy in his early student days, he interested himself in
public affairs, and early gave evidence of talent both as a writer and a
public speaker. Mr. Wylie is noted particularly for his work as a
prohibition propagandist. He was the chief instrument in organizing the
Ontario Young Manhood Association, which in 1914 presented a petition
signed by 10,000 young Conservatives in Ontario to the late Sir James P.
Whitney, then Prime Minister of the Province, asking provincial
prohibition, and which contested unsuccessfully the constituency of
Parkdale in the general election of June in that year. Mr. Wylie is also
credited with having originated the Citizens’ Committee of One Hundred,
of which he became General Secretary, and organized the six months’
whirlwind campaign throughout Ontario which resulted in the passing of
the Ontario Temperance Act in March, 1916. Previous to that he had
participated in the provincial prohibition campaign in Alberta in 1915,
touring that Province and speaking in all the chief cities, as well as
invading some of the mining districts. Mr. Wylie is a close personal
friend of “Billy” Sunday, and has spoken on “No Booze” in the noted
evangelist’s tabernacles in Trenton, Baltimore, and Boston. For some
years he was a member of the staff of the “Globe,” Toronto, and wrote
over the pseudonym of “Will Silo.” He has also contributed to several
other newspapers and magazines. Twice since the outbreak of the war he
offered his services to the army, but each time was rejected on account
of injuries received in a serious automobile accident in 1913. He has,
however, taken a prominent part in recruiting work, giving his services
freely as a speaker and as an organizer in various schemes for raising
funds, especially in connection with the 126th, 182nd and 201st
Battalions. He is a member of the following clubs:—Canadian Club,
Toronto Board of Trade, Walt Whitman, Harvard Union, Toronto Press Club,
Toronto Canoe Club, Ontario Young Manhood Association, Citizens’

=Mackenzie, Daniel D., M.P.= for the riding of North Victoria, Cape
Breton, Nova Scotia, is one of the most prominent representatives of the
Liberal party in the House of Commons, and served as Parliamentary
leader of that party following the death of Sir Wilfrid Laurier in
February, 1919, until the return to the House of Hon. W. L. M. King, the
leader elected by the National Liberal Convention which assembled in the
summer of the same year. He was born on January 8, 1859, at Lake
Ainslie, in the heart of the Highland Scottish settlements of that
island, the son of Duncan and Jessie (McMillan) Mackenzie. He was
educated at the Public Schools and at the Sydney (C.B.) Academy, and
became a barrister and attorney-at-law, practising at North Sydney. He
early became prominent in politics, and has been a most successful
candidate. In nearly a score of elections, municipal, provincial and
federal, where he has been a candidate, he has never met defeat. He
served as Commissioner of Schools for Cape Breton for a time, and was
elected ten times to the Municipal Council of North Sydney, serving as
Mayor for five years. He was elected to the Nova Scotia Legislature in
1900 as a Liberal, and again at the general elections of 1901. Prior to
the general elections for the House of Commons in 1904, he resigned his
seat in the Legislature to become a Federal candidate and was elected.
He resigned, and was appointed Judge of District No. 7, County Court of
Nova Scotia, on February 16, 1906, continuing in that office until
October 15, 1908, when he retired and became again a candidate for the
House of Commons. He was elected, and was equally successful at the
general elections of 1911 and 1917. When the House assembled after the
latter contest, he was the chosen desk-mate of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, then
leader of the Opposition; and on the death of that statesman was elected
by the Liberal caucus to the Parliamentary leadership. At the National
Liberal Convention of August, 1919, he unwillingly allowed his name to
go before the delegates chosen to elect a leader, yielding to pressure
from his Scottish friends in Nova Scotia, but on the election of Mr.
King extended to the latter his heartiest co-operation and support. At
the conclusion of the regular Parliamentary session of 1918-9, he had
the honour of seconding Sir Robert Borden’s resolution of thanks to the
Canadian troops who had fought and died on the battlefields of France
and Flanders. In religion he is a Presbyterian, and on January 28, 1891,
he married Miss Florence N. McDonald, by whom he has one son, Charles
Russell Mackenzie, born May 5, 1895. His home is at North Sydney, C.B.

=Coristine, Major Stanley B.=, is a member of the Board of Pension
Commissioners for Canada, with headquarters in Ottawa, and had a
distinguished career in the great war. He was born at Montreal, Que.,
the son of James Coristine, a prominent business man of that city; was
educated at the Royal Military College, Kingston, Ont., from which he
graduated in 1906, and also took a course at McGill University,
Montreal. After graduation he was for a time connected with James
Coristine & Co., Ltd., but on the outbreak of the war immediately
offered himself for service overseas, and on September 10, 1914, was
gazetted Captain of the 5th Royal Highlanders of Montreal, becoming
Adjutant of the regiment on October 1 of that year. On permission being
granted to organize the 42nd Battalion, R.H.C., he was appointed
adjutant for the period of organization and when the Battalion went
overseas was at his own request placed in command of a company. The 42nd
Battalion was transferred to France in October, 1915, and took part in
much heavy fighting. In June, 1916, during the heavy fighting at Ypres,
known as the “June show” he was seriously wounded and after two months
in hospital was sent home to Canada. In April, 1917, he was discharged
as permanently unfit for further service at the front, and in May of
that year was appointed Secretary of the Pensions Board of Canada. He
showed a very exceptional capacity for dealing with the problems which
came before the Board, and his military record gained him the confidence
of the many injured soldiers with whom his duties brought him in
contact. In 1918 he was appointed a Commissioner to fill the vacancy
created on the Board by the resignation of Major J. L. Todd, and the
choice was generally approved in military circles throughout Canada. He
is a Protestant and a member of St. Paul’s Lodge, A.F. & A.M. His
recreations are golf and tennis, and he is a member of the following
clubs: St. James and University, Montreal; Rideau, and Country, Ottawa.
In 1909 he married Nina, daughter of John McLean, Montreal, and has
three sons: Philip, born 1910; Edward, born 1912; and James, born 1918.

=Watson, Senator Robert=, moved from Ontario to Portage la Prairie,
Manitoba, in 1876, where he built a mill, and later built another mill
at Stonewall. He prospered, became popular, and was well received and
appreciated by the entire community, irrespective of politics. Owing to
his enterprising activities, his generosity, and his sympathetic and
tangible conduct towards those less fortunate than he, he was soon
elected to the Municipal Council, and as a councillor was instrumental
in the adoption of municipal measures that aided in a marked degree the
progressive and harmonious state of affairs in that thriving town. The
Provincial Government and the Province’s representative in the House of
Commons had been Conservative from the time, July 15, 1870, the Province
entered Confederation, and with the return of the Conservatives to power
at Ottawa in 1878, and Hon. John Norquay as Prime Minister, President of
the Council, and Provincial Treasurer at Winnipeg, and four Conservative
spokesmen for the Province occupying seats in the House of Commons, the
young Province was but a helpless political toy in the hands of those
who were elected to, and should have, looked after its best interests.
Suffering for want of proper railway facilities, the situation became
unbearable. Led by Hon. John Norquay, Provincial railway charters were
being issued, only later to be disallowed by the Dominion Government,
all of which, while the public was being led to believe differently, was
fully understood and agreed upon beforehand by both Governments.
Something had to be done to save the Province, and to place it on a
higher plane. An agitation arose, several indignation meetings were held
and finally, in the town of Portage la Prairie, the Provincial Rights
Party was born, and Robert Watson, Portage la Prairie’s millwright,
became the ideal candidate of the party to carry the banner for
Marquette at the general Dominion election. In each of the five Manitoba
Dominion constituencies (a new constituency for the Province had been
created by the Dominion Government), a Provincial Rights Party candidate
was nominated, and three of the five were elected, Winnipeg and
Provencher, with Captain Thos. Scott and Joseph Royal, remained
Conservative, but Lisgar, Marquette and Selkirk, with A. W. Ross, Robert
Watson and Hugh Sutherland, became Provincial Rights constituencies. Out
of these three, however—Ross, Watson and Sutherland—from and including
1882 and 1887, Mr. Watson was practically the only Liberal member in the
House of Commons west of Lake Superior, and he is just as true and
reliable to-day as he was when he first entered political life in 1882.
Senator Robert Watson is the son of the late George Watson, of
Edinburgh, Scotland, who came to Canada in 1847, and his wife Elizabeth
McDonald, of Inverness-shire, Scotland. He was born at Elora, Ontario,
April 29, 1853. In 1876, he moved to Manitoba, and was elected to the
House of Commons for Marquette at the general elections in 1882, 1887
and 1891. He resigned to accept the portfolio of Minister of Public
Works in the Greenway Administration, 1892, and was elected at the
general elections of that year to the Legislature for Portage la
Prairie, and again at the general election of 1896. At the general
election of 1899 he was defeated. January 29, 1900, he was summoned to
the Senate. July, 1880, Senator Watson married Isabella, daughter of
Duncan Brown, of Lobo, Ontario. He is a Presbyterian, and his home
address is Portage la Prairie, Manitoba.

=Sutherland, Fred C.=, Stock Broker, 12 King St. East, Toronto, was born
March 17, 1880, in West River, Nova Scotia, and received his education
at Pictou Academy. He entered his present business in 1909 and became
actively engaged in the development of Northern Ontario’s natural
resources, being instrumental in bringing in hundreds of thousands of
dollars for the advancement of mining interests in the districts of
Porcupine, Kirkland Lake, West Shining Tree and Fort Matachewan. The
firm of F. C. Sutherland & Co. is one of the largest of its kind in
Canada, besides its large and finely appointed head office, having
branch offices in Montreal, Boston, Springfield, Buffalo, Detroit and
New York. He has surrounded himself with a staff of the most capable
mining experts, and his sound judgment, based on first-hand information
has proven of great value to his large clientele of investors. Though
his time is constantly in demand by his clients and the investing public
as well as in directing both internal and external affairs of his
extensive interests he is invariably genial and unruffled, having the
happy faculty of being able to divert his attention rapidly from one
subject to another yet keeping closely in touch with each till disposed
of. He is a member of The Board of Trade, the Lambton Golf Club, a
Protestant, a Unionist in politics and the possessor of an unusually
pleasing personality.

=Taylor, Lt.-Col. Hon. George= (Gananoque), the second son of the late
William Taylor and his wife Ann Graham, both of the north of Ireland.
Was born at Lansdowne, County Leeds, Ontario, March 31, 1840, and has
been for years one of the most popular figures in the public life of
this Dominion. Educated in the Public Schools of Lansdowne, the Hon. Mr.
Taylor began life in the mercantile business as a clerk in a country
general store at the age of eleven years, where he worked for £1 a
month, and continued with the same firm as partner over twenty-five
years. On retiring from the mercantile business above mentioned, the
Hon. Mr. Taylor re-organized the Ontario Wheel Company, to manufacture
carriage wheels, and has been President of the Company for thirty years.
He has been Reeve of Gananoque for seven years, and Warden of the United
Counties of Leeds and Grenville, of which he was County Auditor, 1881.
Was first elected to the House of Commons as a Conservative candidate
for the County of Leeds in the general elections of 1882, and was
re-elected at every general election held since up to 1911 when he
resigned his seat to create a vacancy for Sir Thomas White, who had been
appointed Minister of Finance in the Borden Cabinet. During his long
parliamentary career Hon. Mr. Taylor was chief Whip of the Conservative
party for twenty-five years under Sir John A. MacDonald, Sir John
Abbott, Sir John Thompson, Sir Mackenzie Bowell, Sir Charles Tupper and
Sir Robert Borden. Shortly after his retirement from the House of
Commons, on November 17, 1911, the subject of this sketch was summoned
to the Senate, and since his appointment to the Upper Chamber has taken
an active part in its deliberations. On retiring from the House of
Commons, he received a handsome testimonial of esteem from his
colleagues. Hon. Mr. Taylor, during his career in public life, has
always received the good will of all classes of citizens. He is the soul
of good humor, broadminded, generous and a liberal gentleman, and has
been called “The John Hampden” of this Dominion. He is the Honorary
Colonel of the 156th Battalion of Leeds and Grenville and President of
the Peace River Land Company and a member of the following societies:
Orange, Masonic, Oddfellows, United Workmen, Royal Arcanum and
Foresters. Senator Taylor was married on September 10, 1863, to Margaret
Ann Latimer, daughter of James and Ellen Latimer and ward of Major James
Kirker of Gananoque. They celebrated their golden wedding Sept. 10,
1913. Mrs. Taylor died Mar. 12, 1917. Mr. Taylor afterwards married
Lilian Coleman, daughter of the late Mr. Anson Clark Coleman and his
wife Hannah Witton, of Delta, both Canadians of English descent.

=Richardson, John= (Toronto, Ont.), was born in Scarboro Township,
County of York, Ontario, in 1843, on the farm of his father, the late
Ezekiel Richardson. He received his education at the Public School,
Scarboro Village, at the Grammar School, Markham Village, and at
Victoria College, Cobourg. After completing his education he returned to
his old home and engaged in the business of farming until 1894. Early in
life he took an active interest in public affairs in his native
township. In 1875 he was induced to accept nomination and was a
successful candidate for a seat in the Township Council and was
re-elected for nineteen years consecutively, three years as Councilman,
two years as Deputy Reeve and fourteen years as Reeve. In 1885 he was
elected Warden of the County of York, the highest municipal position in
the County. The City of Toronto and the County of York are united for
judicial purposes. Mr. Richardson was for many years Chairman of the
Legislation Committee and as such had much to do with framing
legislation beneficial to the Metropolitan City and County. In December,
1894, he retired from the Reeveship of Scarboro, he having been elected
by the constituency of East York as their representative in the Ontario
Legislature, which position he held for ten years, being re-elected in
1892 and 1902. He was a Liberal in politics and was a supporter of the
administrations of Sir Oliver Mowat, Hon. A. S. Hardy and Sir George W.
Ross. In 1902 he lost his health, the strenuous life of a politician was
too severe for him. In 1904 he was compelled to forego his political
ambitions and withdraw from political life. In December of that year Sir
George W. Ross, then Premier of Ontario, appointed him to the position
of Clerk of the County Court of the County of York, which position he
held until his death. Mr. Richardson’s father emigrated from the North
of Ireland in 1824, and settled in Scarboro. In 1831 he married Miss
Mary Hunter, an English girl. Their descendants being five sons and four
daughters. James and Ezekiel, who were ordained Methodist Ministers, and
Joseph and Samuel, who graduated in medicine, now deceased. Three
sisters survive—Mrs. A. Barber, Bowmanville; Mrs. E. Draper and Mrs. H.
Aylard, of Toronto. He was a Director of the York Fire Insurance Co., a
member of the Acacia Lodge A.F. & A.M., and a Methodist in religion. He
was a philanthropist, in a quiet way, many owing their success in life
to his generosity. By his honest and straightforward actions in both his
political and private life, he won the confidence and respect of the
community at large. Mr. Richardson died at Toronto, in September, 1914,
after a very active career.

=Doughty, Arthur George, M.A., C.M.G., Litt.D., LL.D., F.R.S.C.,
F.R.C.I.=, Archivist for the Dominion of Canada, is perhaps the greatest
living authority on Canadian history, and a scholar of international
repute. He was born at Maidenhead, England, on March 22, 1860, the son
of William John Doughty. He was educated at the public schools,
Maidenhead, Lord Eldon College, London, New Inn Hall, Oxford University,
and Dickenson College, Carlisle, when he was awarded the M.A. degree in
1890. Ten years later he became Docteur de Lettres of Laval University,
Montreal, and in 1912 received the Honorary Degree of LL.D. at Queen’s
University, Kingston, Ont. As a young man Dr. Doughty contemplated
entering the Church, and was engaged in religious work at All Hallows
Mission, Southwark, London, and in other institutions. Circumstances,
however, altered this intention and in the nineties he came to Canada
and was engaged for a time in commercial pursuits at Montreal, utilizing
his leisure for literary work. In 1897 he was appointed Private
Secretary to the Minister of Public Works at Quebec, and in 1899-1901
served in a similar capacity with the Provincial Treasurer of Quebec. In
the latter year he was appointed joint librarian of the Quebec
Legislature, and on May 16, 1904, became Dominion Archivist and Keeper
of the Records for Canada, with headquarters in the Archives Building,
Ottawa. His indefatigable labors in that office have raised it to very
large importance. In 1907 he was appointed a member of the Canadian
Historical Manuscripts Commission, and in 1908 a member of the literary
committee of the Quebec Battlefields Commission. In 1909 he became a
member of the Dominion Geographic Board. One of the greatest historical
services he has been able to render Canada was at the conclusion of the
great war in 1918 when he went to Great Britain and France and secured a
magnificent collection of war trophies as the permanent possession of
Canada, to be apportioned among various Canadian cities. Dr. Doughty
early acquired rare skill as an illuminator on vellum and decorated the
book presented to the present King and Queen on their visit to Quebec in
1901. He is also an expert in shorthand, and has published an edition of
Tennyson’s “In Memoriam” in that script. At the same time he has been
prolific in many forms of literary effort, as the following list of
publications shows: “The Life and Works of Lord Tennyson,” 1893; “Rose
Leaves,” 1894; “The Song Story of Francesco and Beatrice,” 1896; “Nugæ
Canoræ,” 1897; “The Site of the Battle of the Plains of Abraham,” 1918;
“The Siege of Quebec,” in six volumes, 1901-2 (written in collaboration
with George W. Parmalee); “The Struggle for Supremacy,” 1905; “Documents
relating to the Constitutional History of Canada” (with Prof. Adam
Shortt), 1907; “The Cradle of New France,” 1908; “Index and Dictionary
of Canadian History” (with L. J. Burpee), 1911; joint editor of “Canada
and Its Provinces,” in twenty-two volumes; joint editor of “Documents
Relating to the Constitutional History of Canada from 1791 to 1818,”
published 1914; Editor of General Knox’s “Journal of Campaigns in North
America,” published in three volumes by the Champlain Society, 1914;
“The Acadian Exiles,” 1915; “A Daughter of New France,” 1915. Dr.
Doughty has also contributed to the Encyclopedia Brittanica,
Encyclopedia Americana, the Catholic Encyclopedia, and to many magazines
and historical journals. His lighter efforts have included the libretto
of a comic opera “Bonnie Prince Charlie.” He is a member of the Canadian
Society of Authors, Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, Fellow of the
Royal Colonial Institute, Fellow of the Royal Historical Society of
Great Britain, and a member of the Literary and Historical Society of
Quebec. In 1905 he was honored with the decoration of C.M.G. He married,
first, Bertha Van Kehrweider, in June, 1886, who died January, 1910;
secondly, Kathleen Rathbun Browne, daughter of George A. Browne,
Montreal, in June, 1911. In religion he is a Roman Catholic, and is a
member of the Rideau Club, and the Ottawa Golf Club. He resides at 490

Somerset, Nova Scotia, on January 7, 1887, the son of Rev. Thomas
McFall, a Reformed Presbyterian clergyman, and his wife, Anna Lyons. His
education was remarkably complete. After studying at the public schools
of Nova Scotia he went to Geneva College, Beaver Falls, Penna.,
graduating with the degree of B.A. in 1912. This was followed by
post-graduate courses at Glasgow University, Scotland, and Columbia
University, New York City. He took a scholarship at the latter
institution in 1913, and in 1914 captured the Garth Fellowship in
Political Economy—a much-coveted honor. He received the degree of A.M.
in 1914 and Ph.D. in 1916. For two years, 1915-17, he had charge of the
work in Transportation and Commerce in the Department of Economics at
the University of Minnesota, and in 1917 returned to Canada to become
Chief of the Internal Trade Division, Dominion Bureau of Statistics, at
Ottawa. In August of that year he also became statistician of the Canada
Food Board, an office he held until February, 1919. He served also as
Cost of Living Commissioner from May, 1918, to August, 1919, when the
work of this office was merged in that of the Board of Commerce. During
his tenure of office as Cost of Living Commissioner Dr. McFall proved
most efficient and won high encomiums for his fearless performance of
his duties. Among his publications is a valuable treatise on the
transportation question “Railway Monopoly and Rate Regulation,”
published in 1916 by Longmans, Green & Company. In addition to various
official reports he has written numerous magazine and newspaper articles
on the subject of transportation and food supplies, for American and
Canadian publications. He is a member of the American Economic
Association and of the Canadian Club, Ottawa. In religion he is a
Presbyterian, and in politics, independent. On September 29, 1917, he
married Marjorie, daughter of Rev. E. S. Carr, D.D., Peoria, Ill., and
has one daughter, Alice, born November 6, 1918. His residence is at 353

=Amyot, Lieut.-Col. John A., C.M.G.=, Deputy Minister of the Federal
Department of Public Health, Ottawa, is an authority on the subject of
public sanitation and the prevention of disease. He was born at Toronto
on July 25, 1867, the son of John F. Amyot, a railroad man, and his
wife, Sophie Féré. He was educated at the separate schools, St. Thomas,
Ont., Assumption College, Sandwich, Ont. and at the University of
Toronto, from which he graduated with the degree of M.B. in 1891. He was
immediately appointed a house surgeon of Toronto General Hospital,
serving for one year; and from 1892 to 1900 was Demonstrator in
Pathology on the University of Toronto Medical Faculty. From 1894 to
1898 he was Assistant Surgeon at St. Michael’s Hospital, Toronto, and
from 1898 to 1900, Surgeon. Among other professional offices he filled
were those of Lecturer in Comparative Physiology at the Ontario
Veterinary College, 1898-1908; Director of the Laboratory of the
Provincial Board of Health, Ontario, 1900-1918; Associate Professor of
Pathology, University of Toronto, 1900-09, and Professor of Hygiene at
the same institution, 1909-1918. A year before the outbreak of the great
war he had become identified with the Canadian Army Medical Corps and
held the commission of D.A.D.M.S. (Sanitation) for the 2nd Canadian
Divisional Area, from 1913 to 1915. In that capacity he had much to do
with preserving the health of large bodies of troops who were placed in
training in that area after the outbreak of the war in 1914. In the
spring of 1915 he went to England on staff of No. 4 Can. Gen. Hospital,
was made officer in charge of Sanitation, 2nd Canadian Division whilst
in England, and in the latter part of that year was transferred to
France as O.C. of the Sanitary Section of the 1st Canadian Division. In
1916 he became Chief Adviser in Sanitation with the Canadian Army Corps
in France, and later in the same year was seconded to the Imperial
forces as D.A.D.M.S. (Sanitation) with the 2nd British Army in France.
From 1916 to 1918 he was also Consultant in Sanitation with the Canadian
Overseas Forces, England. The low percentage of deaths from communicable
disease in the British and Canadian armies during the war, was regarded
as miraculous when compared with the statistics of all past wars, and to
this desirable condition, which greatly aided in the victory,
Lieut.-Col. Amyot is considered as having largely contributed. He was
twice mentioned in despatches for service under fire while in France in
1916, and three times won similar recognition for his zeal in combatting
disease among the troops in England. In recognition of his abilities he
was personally decorated with the C.M.G. by His Majesty. In July, 1919,
he was appointed by the administration of Sir Robert Borden, Deputy
Minister of the newly created Department of Public Health, and entrusted
with the work of organizing it on modern lines. Col. Amyot’s writings
include various papers on questions of public health published in Canada
and the United States. He has also collaborated on Technical commissions
in connection with the United States and Canadian Public Health
Associations, and the Ontario and Canadian Medical Associations. He is
also a co-director of the International Waterways Commission, and in
that capacity has conducted investigations on the pollution of the
waters of the Great Lakes. He is a Roman Catholic in religion and a
member of the Toronto Board of Trade, the University and Canadian Clubs,
Toronto, and the Faculty Union of Toronto University. On May 21, 1895,
he married Mary J. Keller, daughter of Francis and Mary (Stuart) Keller,
Whitby, Ont., and has five sons and two daughters, John Francis, Gregory
Féré, William Keller, Joseph, Mary, Francis and Sophie. His residence is
at Slater St., Ottawa.

represented that constituency for two parliaments, having been
re-elected by a handsome majority at the general elections in 1914. He
was born in Dublin, Ireland, and received his early education there, in
Manchester, England, and in the Forrest City. He became a student-at-law
in the office of Cronyn and Greenlees, of London, and shortly after
passing the bar removed to Toronto, where he joined the firm of Leys,
Reid and Owens, the head of the firm being the late John Leys, Q.C.,

practice. His manner is extremely affable, never ruffled, and constantly
active. Since coming to Toronto, he always took an active part in the
Conservative interest, and for years was President of the Central
Conservative Association before being elected member of the Legislature.
He can speak well and to the point when occasion demands, but has earned
the reputation of taking up less time on the floor of the house than any
other member of equal ability. He is unmarried, but has none of the
crotchety characteristics sometimes attributed to the bachelor of middle

staff of the Dominion Savings and Investment Society. He resigned his
position in this company some twenty years ago, and removed to Toronto,
where he became engaged in the real estate business, which he still
conducts at 79 Victoria Street. At an early age he took great interest
in politics, and on his arrival in Toronto soon became a well known and
active worker for the Conservative party in the city. For years he held
different offices in the local Conservative organizations, and in 1907
he was elected President of Ward 3 Conservative Association, holding
that position for the unprecedented period of seven years, till elected
to his present position in 1914 for seat “B” in South-East Toronto by a
large majority. During the war he was untiring in his recruiting

the early nineties, he represented the Sun Life Assurance Company of
Canada in Great Britain for two years, and subsequently returned to this
country to associate himself with the Mutual Life Insurance Company of
New York, the oldest Company of its kind in America. He was appointed
Superintendent of Agencies for the Maritime Provinces, with headquarters
at Halifax, and subsequently moved to Toronto as Superintendent for
Ontario. In 1905 he became manager for this province, a position he
still holds. He has become largely identified with the financial
interests of the province, and is one of the greatest authorities on
life insurance as an investment proposition in this or any other
country. The sum total of the policies he has written would run into
millions, and many of them have reached large sums like $100,000 or
$200,000. After moving to Toronto, he still maintained a home at Athens,
Ont., where he became largely interested in agriculture, and at one time
owned farm property in the Brockville district. It was because of his
loyal attachment to the county of his birth that in 1905 the
Conservatives of Brockville riding tendered him the nomination for the
Legislature in opposition to the sitting member, Hon. George P. Graham,
at that time a member of the Ross Government. Though his party was
successful at the polls, Mr. Donovan was unable to overcome the personal
following of Mr. Graham in the Brockville district. Subsequently, in
1907, when Mr. Graham retired from the Ontario Legislature to join the
Laurier cabinet at Ottawa, Mr. Donovan was again nominated and at a
by-election in October, 1907, was successful in redeeming the riding by
a large majority. His victory was the more signal, inasmuch as
Brockville had sent a Liberal member to the Legislature at every
election for many years, and was regarded as impregnable by that party.
Though on each occasion strongly opposed, Mr. Donovan was again elected
by large majorities at the general elections of 1908, 1911 and 1914.
From the occasion of his first speech in the Ontario Legislature, he has
been recognized as an important factor in the deliberations of that
body, his fine oratorical gifts being as marked as the sound
intellectual quality of his deliverances. On many occasions regret has
been expressed that Mr. Donovan’s business interests have precluded his
accepting cabinet preferment. During the late war he turned his
abilities as a speaker to patriotic uses, and is credited with having
recruited more men for the Canadian army than any other member of either
the House of Commons or the various legislatures of this country. His
efforts covered the entire province of Ontario, and in the year 1915 he
individually secured the enlistment of 1,260 soldiers. Personally, he is
popular with men of all shades of opinion, and is a member of the Albany
Club, Toronto, the Brockville Club, and the Canadian Club, Toronto, and
of the Executive of the Empire Club of Canada. In religion he is a
Methodist, and is a member of the A.F. and A.M. and the I.O.O.F. He
married Ella B., daughter of Duncan Fisher, and has two sons, Albert
Edward and John Alexander, and one daughter, Helen M. Donovan. His
residence is at 284 Huron Street, Toronto.

=Crannell, Levi=, is one of the leading lumbermen of Ottawa, with
interests that embrace both Canada and the United States; and has also
played a prominent part in public affairs at the Canadian capital. He
was born in Albany, N.Y., on October 7, 1842, the son of Henry and Eliza
Crannell. His father was a prominent lumberman of the ante-bellum period
in New York State, and the subject of this sketch was educated in the
public schools of Albany, with a view to taking up the same line of
activity. At the time he attained manhood, Ottawa was, as now, a centre
of the lumbering industry. Coming to Canada many years ago, Mr. Crannell
became associated with the business now known as the Bronson Company,
Limited, ground wood pulp and lumber manufacturers, Ottawa, of which he
is still an active partner. This company is the offspring of an old
lumber firm established at Bytown (the early name of Ottawa) in 1852 by
J. J. Harris and Henry Franklin Bronson, both of whom came from the
United States to operate newly-acquired timber limits. Mr. Harris
retired in 1864, and for over forty years thereafter the business was
carried on under the name of the Bronson and Weston Lumber Company,
until the present title was adopted. Mr. Crannell threw himself heart
and soul into the aspirations of the young Canadian nation, and became a
naturalized citizen in 1875. His interests have expanded with the times,
and now include California as well as the Ottawa Valley. A good many
years ago, foreseeing the growth of the redwood industry on the Pacific
Coast, he acquired timber properties there, and twelve years ago the
Little River Redwood Company, of Budwinkie, California, commenced
manufacturing operations. Of this company Mr. Crannell is President, and
other members of the Bronson firm directors and shareholders. By this
industry Budwinkie has been turned into a happy and flourishing
industrial centre. Direct railroad connections with the mills have been
established, and handsome houses built by the company for all employees,
married or single. For the latter class, the company operates a
community dining room, at which from 350 to 400 meals are served daily.
It is evidence of the growing international importance of the redwood
industry that over one-third of the company’s manufactured product is
exported to other countries, and the demand both foreign and domestic is
constantly growing. It is a cedar of exquisite quality, and in its
finished condition makes a very handsome article. The American interests
of Mr. Crannell have not prevented his playing an important part in
public life. He served as alderman from 1889 to 1892, and sat on the
following municipal committees: Water Works, Board of Health, Printing,
Fire and Light, and Court of Revision. When nominated for mayor of that
city in 1896, his requisition paper was signed by over one thousand
ratepayers, representing all creeds and classes. His integrity, energy
and independence of thought are proverbial among those who know him, and
he is generous in his contributions to philanthropic objects. The
benefactions of the Bronson firm since its earliest days are well known,
and have brought cheer and happiness to hundreds of poor homes at
Christmas time and during hard winters. Mr. Crannell has been an
especially good friend to the Orphans’ Home, the Old Men’s Home, and,
indeed, all hospitals and charitable institutions in Ottawa owe much to
his generosity and initiative. He has twice been married: on the first
occasion on November 11, 1863, to Julia A. Woolcott, and secondly, on
January 26, 1876 to Gertrude E., daughter of the late Henry F. Bronson,
of Ottawa. He has three sons, Edward Wilber, Alfred Raymond, and Levi
Wilfrid, and two adopted daughters, Edith L. and Jennie G. Crannell. In
religion he is a Presbyterian, and in politics a Unionist.

=Marshall, Lieut.-Col. Kenric Reid, C.M.G., D.S.O.=, is the eldest son
of Hon. Col. Noel Marshall, capitalist of Toronto, and his wife, H. T.
Hogg (deceased), born in Toronto, October 13, 1880. He was educated in
private schools and Upper Canada College. At the age of nineteen he
began his business career with the Standard Fuel Co., of which his
father was president, and continued active connection with that company
till the war broke out. He married, October 20, 1909, Marion J.,
daughter of Angus Kirkland, Esq., banker (deceased). He has one son,
Peter K. Marshall. On the outbreak of war Colonel Marshall, who was then
a junior Captain in the 48th Highlanders, proceeded overseas with the
15th Battalion, but was unable to accompany his unit to France owing to
an attack of pneumonia, contracted on Salisbury Plains, which rendered
him unfit for general service for the greater part of 1915, though he
was able to perform light duties in France and England for part of that
year. In May, 1916, he was passed fit for duty, shortly after being
appointed Staff Captain to Brigadier-General Lord Brooke’s Brigade in
the newly-formed 4th Canadian Division, and served under this officer
until Lord Brooke was wounded in September, 1916, and the 12th Canadian
Infantry Brigade came under the command of Brigadier-General J. H.
MacBrien, C.B., etc. Colonel Marshall served with General MacBrien
through the Battle of the Somme, and for his part in this operation
received the Distinguished Service Order. In the early part of 1917 he
was promoted to the rank of Major, and given an appointment under the
late Major-General Lipsett, who commanded the 3rd Canadian Division.
After some nine months’ service with this distinguished commander he was
recommended as qualified to fill the appointment of Adjutant and
Quartermaster-General of a division, and was subsequently promoted to
that post in the 4th Canadian Division under Major-General Sir David
Watson, K.C.B., and given the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel, being one of
the first officers who had not passed through the Staff College at
Camberley to become a first-grade Staff Officer in the field. Lt.-Col.
Marshall remained throughout the balance of the campaign in the above
capacity receiving the C.M.G. for his part in connection with the
battles of 1918. He was mentioned in despatches on three occasions.
Lt.-Col. Marshall is President of the Standard Fuel Co. of Toronto,
founded fifty years ago, at present doing a large retail business
throughout Ontario. He is fond of outdoor life, and is a member of
several prominent clubs, The Toronto Hunt, National, Rosedale Golf, etc.
He is an Anglican and Conservative. His favorite recreations are farming
and polo. His city residence is 97 Glen Road, and his country home and
farm at Dunbarton. Col. Marshall is an alert business man, with a very
pleasing personality.
