                              INTRODUCTION


The letters contained in this volume cover a large and important period
in Cicero’s life and in the history of Rome. They begin when he was 38
years of age; and at first they are not very numerous. There are only
two of that year (68 B.C.), six of the following year, one of the year
66, when he held the praetorship, and two of 65. Then there is a gap in
his correspondence. No letters at all survive from the period of his
consulship and the Catilinarian conspiracy; and the letters to Atticus
do not begin again until two years after that event. Thereafter they are
sufficiently frequent to justify Cornelius Nepos’ criticism, that
reading them, one has little need of an elaborate history of the period.
There are full—almost too full—details, considering the frequent
complaints and repetitions, during the year of his banishment (58–57
B.C.), and the correspondence continues unbroken to the year 54. Then
after a lapse of two years or more, which Atticus presumably spent in
Rome, it begins again in 51, when Cicero was sent to Cilicia as
pro-consul, much against his will; and the volume ends with a hint of
the trouble that was brewing between Caesar and Pompey, as Cicero was
returning to Rome towards the end of the next year.

The letters have been translated in the traditionary order in which they
are usually printed. That order, however, is not strictly chronological;
and, for the convenience of those who would read them in their
historical order, a table arranging them so far as possible in order of
date has been drawn up at the end of the volume.

For the basis of the text the Teubner edition has been used; but it has
been revised by comparison with more recent works and papers on the
subject. Textual notes have only been given in a few cases where the
reading is especially corrupt or uncertain; and other notes too have
been confined to cases where they seemed absolutely indispensable. For
such notes and in the translation itself, I must acknowledge my
indebtedness to predecessors, especially to Tyrrell’s indispensable
edition and Shuckburgh’s excellent translation.

There remain two small points to which I may perhaps call attention here
in case they should puzzle the general reader. The first is that, when
he finds the dates in this volume disagreeing with the rules and tables
generally given in Latin grammars and taught in schools, he must please
to remember that those rules apply only to the Julian Calendar, which
was introduced in 45 B.C., and that these letters were written before
that date. Before the alterations introduced by Caesar, March, May, July
and October had 31 days each, February 28, and the other months 29.
Compared with the Julian Calendar this shows a difference of two days in
all dates which fall between the Ides and the end of the months January,
August and December, and of one day in similar dates in April, June,
September and November.

The second point, which requires explanation, is the presence of some
numerals in the margin of the text of letters 16 to 19 of Book IV. As
Mommsen pointed out, the archetype from which the existent MSS. were
copied must have had some of the leaves containing these letters
transposed. These were copied in our MSS. in the wrong order, and were
so printed in earlier editions. In the text Mommsen’s order, with some
recent modifications introduced by Holzapfel, has been adopted; and the
figures in the margin denote the place of the transposed passages in the
older editions, the Roman figures denoting the letter from which each
particular passage has been shifted and the Arabic numerals the section
of that letter.

The following signs have been used in the apparatus criticus:—

  _M_ = the _Codex Mediceus_ 49, 18, written in the year 1389 A.D., and
    now preserved in the Laurentian Library at Florence. _M_^1 denotes
    the reading of the first hand, and _M_^2 that of a reviser.

  Δ = the reading of _M_ when supported by that of the _Codex Urbinas_
    322, a MS. of the 15th century, preserved in the Vatican Library.

  _E_ = _Codex Ambrosianus_ E, 14, a MS. probably of the 14th century,
    in the Ambrosian Library at Milan.

  _N_ = the _Codex ex abbatia Florentina_ n. 49 in the Laurentian
    Library, written in the 14th or 15th century.

  _P_ = No. 8536 of the Latin MSS. in the Bibliothèque Nationale at
    Paris, a MS. of the 15th century.

  _R_ = No. 8538 of the same collection, written in the year 1419. These
    four MSS. _E_, _N_, _P_, _R_, with some others form a separate
    class; and

  Σ = the reading of all the MSS. of this class, or of a preponderant
    number of them.

  _C_ = the marginal readings in Cratander’s edition of 1528, drawn from
    a MS. which is now lost.

  _Z_ = the readings of the lost _Codex Tornaesianus_, _Z_^b denoting
    the reading as preserved by Bosius, and _Z_^l that testified to by
    Lambinus.

  _I_ = the reading of the _editio Jensoniana_ published at Venice in
    1470.

  _Rom._ = the edition published at Rome in 1470.

videantur, Galba et Antonius et Q. Cornificius. Puto te in hoc aut
risisse aut ingemuisse. Ut frontem ferias, sunt, qui etiam Caesonium
putent. Aquilium non arbitrabamur, qui denegavit et iuravit morbum et
illud suum regnum iudiciale opposuit. Catilina, si iudicatum erit
meridie non lucere, certus erit competitor. De Aufidio et Palicano non

[Sidenote: _Rome, July_, B.C. _65_]

With regard to my candidature, in which I know you take the greatest
interest, things stand as follows, so far as one can guess at present.
P. Galba is the only canvasser who is hard at work; and he meets with a
plain and simple, old-fashioned, No. As people think, this unseemly
haste of his in canvassing is by no means a bad thing for my interests:
for most refusals imply a pledge of support to me. So I have hope that I
may derive some advantage from it, when the news gets abroad that my
supporters are in the majority. I had thought of beginning to canvass in
the Campus Martius at the election of tribunes on the 17th of July, the
very time that, Cincius tells me, your man will be starting with this
letter. It seems certain that Galba, Antonius, and Q. Cornificius will
be standing with me. I can imagine your smile or sigh at the news. To
make you tear your hair, there are some who think Caesonius will be a
candidate too. I don’t suppose Aquilius will. He has said not, pleading
his illness and his supremacy in the law courts in excuse. Catiline will
be sure to be standing, if the verdict is, No sun at midday. Of course
you will know all about Aufidius and Palicanus, without waiting for
letters from me. Of those who are standing, Caesar is thought to be a
certainty: the real fight is expected

existimatur; qui sic inopes et ab amicis et existimatione sunt, ut mihi
videatur non esse ἀδύνατον Curium obducere. Sed hoc praeter me nemini
videtur. Nostris rationibus maxime conducere videtur Thermum fieri cum
Caesare. Nemo est enim ex iis, qui nunc petunt, qui, si in nostrum annum
reciderit, firmior candidatus fore videatur, propterea quod curator est
viae Flaminiae, quae tum erit absoluta sane facile. Eum libenter nunc
Caesari consuli accuderim.[1] Petitorum haec est adhuc informata
cogitatio. Nos in omni munere candidatorio fungendo summam adhibebimus
diligentiam, et fortasse, quoniam videtur in suffragiis multum posse
Gallia, cum Romae a iudiciis forum refrixerit, excurremus mense
Septembri legati ad Pisonem, ut Ianuario revertamur. Cum perspexero
voluntates nobilium, scribam ad te. Cetera spero prolixa esse his
dumtaxat urbanis competitoribus. Illam manum tu mihi cura ut praestes,
quoniam propius abes, Pompei, nostri amici. Nega me ei iratum fore, si
ad mea comitia non venerit. Atque haec huius modi sunt.

Sed est, quod abs te mihi ignosci pervelim. Caecilius, avunculus tuus, a
P. Vario cum magna pecunia fraudaretur, agere coepit cum eius fratre A.
Caninio Satyro de iis rebus, quas eum dolo malo mancipio accepisse de
Vario diceret. Una agebant ceteri creditores, in quibus erat L. Lucullus
et P. Scipio et, is quem putabant magistrum fore, si bona venirent, L.

to lie between Thermus and Silanus. But they are so unpopular and so
unknown, that it seems to me to be on the cards to smuggle in Curius.
Nobody else thinks so, however. It would probably suit our book best for
Thermus to get in with Caesar: for, of the present batch of candidates,
he would be the most formidable rival if he were put off to my year, as
he is commissioner for the repairing of the Flaminian road. That will
easily be finished by then: so I should like to lump him together with
Caesar now. Such is the present rough guess of the chances of the
candidates. I shall take the greatest care to fulfil all a candidate’s
duties: and, as Gaul’s vote counts high, I shall probably get a free
pass and take a run up to visit Piso, as soon as things have quieted
down in the law courts here, returning in January. When I have
discovered the views of the upper ten, I will let you know. The rest I
hope will be plain sailing, with my civilian rivals at any rate. For our
friend Pompey’s followers you must be responsible, as you are quite
close to them. Tell him I shall not take it unkindly if he does not come
to my election. So much for that.

But there is a thing for which I have to crave your pardon. Your uncle,
Caecilius, was cheated out of a large sum of money by P. Varius, and has
taken an action against his brother, A. Caninius Satyrus, about some
property which he says was fraudulently made over to him by Varius. The
other creditors have made common cause with him: and among them are L.
Lucullus and P. Scipio and the man who was expected to act for them at
the sale, if the goods were put up for auction, L. Pontius.

Pontius. Verum hoc ridiculum est de magistro. Nunc cognosce rem. Rogavit
me Caecilius, ut adessem contra Satyrum. Dies fere nullus est, quin hic
Satyrus domum meam ventitet; observat L. Domitium maxime, me habet
proximum; fuit et mihi et Quinto fratri magno usui in nostri
petitionibus. Sane sum perturbatus cum ipsius Satyri familiaritate tum
Domiti, in quo uno maxime ambitio nostra nititur. Demonstravi haec
Caecilio simul et illud ostendi, si ipse unus cum illo uno contenderet,
me ei satis facturum fuisse; nunc in causa universorum creditorum,
hominum praesertim amplissimorum, qui sine eo, quem Caecilius suo nomine
perhiberet, facile causam communem sustinerent, aequum esse eum et
officio meo consulere et tempori. Durius accipere hoc mihi visus est,
quam vellem, et quam homines belli solent, et postea prorsus ab
instituta nostra paucorum dierum consuetudine longe refugit.

Abs te peto, ut mihi hoc ignoscas et me existimes humanitate esse
prohibitum, ne contra amici summam existimationem miserrimo eius tempore
venirem, cum is omnia sua studia et officia in me contulisset. Quodsi
voles in me esse durior, ambitionem putabis mihi obstitisse. Ego autem
arbitror, etiamsi id sit, mihi ignoscendum esse,

                     ἐπεὶ οὐχ ἱερήιον οὐδὲ βοείην.

Vides enim, in quo cursu simus et quam omnes gratias non modo
retinendas, verum etiam acquirendas

But it is absurd to talk of acting for them at present. Now for the
point. Caecilius asked me to take a brief against Satyrus. Now there is
hardly a day but Satyrus pays me a visit. He is most attentive to L.
Domitius and after him to me, and he was of great assistance to me and
to my brother Quintus when we were canvassing. I am really embarrassed
on account of the friendliness of Satyrus himself and of Domitius, who
is the mainstay of my hopes. I pointed this out to Caecilius, assuring
him at the same time that, if he stood alone against Satyrus, I would
have done my best for him: but, as things were, when the creditors had
combined and were such influential persons that they would easily win
their case without any special advocate whom Caecilius might retain on
his own account, it was only fair for him to consider my obligations and
my circumstances. He seemed to take it more ungraciously than I could
have wished or than a gentleman should: and afterwards he withdrew
entirely from the intimacy which had grown up between us in the last few
days.

Please try to forgive me and to believe that delicacy prevented me from
appearing against a friend whose very good name was at stake, in the
hour of his misfortune, when the friendly attentions he had paid to me
had been unfailing. If you cannot take so kind a view, pray consider
that my candidature stood in the way. I think even so I may be forgiven:
for there is not “a trifle, some eightpenny matter,”[2] at [Sidenote:
Iliad xxii, 159] stake. You know the game I am playing, and how
important it is for me to keep in with every one and

I beg to inform you that on the very day that L. Julius Caesar and C.
Marcius Figulus were elected to the consulship I was blessed with a baby
boy; and Terentia is doing well. It is ages since I had a letter from
you! I have written before and told you all my affairs. At the present
minute I am thinking about defending my fellow candidate Catiline. We
can have any jury we like with the greatest good will of the prosecutor.
I hope, if Catiline is acquitted, it will make us better friends in our
canvassing: but, if it does not, I shall take it quietly.

I badly want you back soon: for there is a widespread opinion that some
friends of yours among the upper ten are opposed to my election, and I
can see that you will be of the greatest assistance to me in winning
their good will. So be sure you come back to town in January, as you
proposed.

Crebras exspectationes nobis tui commoves. Nuper quidem, cum iam te
adventare arbitraremur; repente abs te in mensem Quintilem reiecti
sumus. Nunc vero sentio, quod commodo tuo facere poteris, venias

to the Alban hill for sacrifice.[5] No doubt Saufeius will send you a
letter of condolence. I am expecting you back by January—from mere
hearsay, or was it perhaps from letters you have sent to others? You
have not said anything about it to me. The statues you have obtained for
me have been landed at Caieta. I’ve not seen them yet, as I’ve not had a
chance of getting away from town: but I’ve sent a man to pay for the
carriage. Many thanks for the trouble you’ve taken in getting them—so
cheaply too.

You keep writing to me to make your peace with our friend. I have tried
every means I know: but it is surprising how estranged he is from you. I
expect you have heard what he thinks about you: anyhow I’ll let you know
when you come. I have not been able to restore the old terms of intimacy
between him and Sallustius, though the latter was on the spot. I mention
it because Sallustius used to grumble at me about you. Now he has found
out that our friend is not so easy to appease, and that I have done my
best for both of you. Our little Tullia is engaged to C. Piso Frugi, son
of Lucius.

You keep on raising our hopes of seeing you: and just the other day,
when we thought you were nearly here, we find ourselves suddenly put off
till July. Now I really do think you ought to keep your promise

  The point is not very clear. My translation follows Mr Strachan
  Davidson’s interpretation that the old lady was thinking of the Social
  War which took place twenty years earlier. Others understand _feriae_
  with _Latinae_. and take it to refer merely to possible delays of the
  festival.

ad id tempus, quod scribis; obieris Quinti fratris comitia, nos longo
intervallo viseris, Acutilianam controversiam transegeris. Hoc me etiam
Peducaeus ut ad te scriberem admonuit. Putamus enim utile esse te
aliquando eam rem transigere. Mea intercessio parata et est et fuit. Nos
hic incredibili ac singulari populi voluntate de C. Macro transegimus.
Cui cum aequi fuissemus, tamen multo maiorem fructum ex populi
existimatione illo damnato cepimus quam ex ipsius, si absolutus esset,
gratia cepissemus.

Quod ad me de Hermathena scribis, per mihi gratum est. Est ornamentum
Academiae proprium meae, quod et Hermes commune omnium et Minerva
singulare est insigne eius gymnasii. Quare velim, ut scribis, ceteris
quoque rebus quam plurimis eum locum ornes. Quae mihi antea signa
misisti, ea nondum vidi; in Formiano sunt, quo ego mine proficisci
cogitabam. Illa omnia in Tusculanum deportabo. Caietam, si quando
abundare coepero, ornabo. Libros tuos conserva et noli desperare eos me
meos facere posse. Quod si adsequor, supero Crassum divitiis atque
omnium vicos et prata contemno.

and come if you possibly can manage it. You will be in time for my
brother Quintus’ election: you will see me after all this long while;
and you will settle the bother with Acutilius. The latter point
Peducaeus too suggested that I should mention to you: we think it would
be much better for you to get the thing settled at last. I am and have
long been ready to use my influence for you. You would never believe how
pleased every one is with my conduct of Macer’s case. I might certainly
have shown more partiality to him: but the popularity I have gained from
his condemnation is far more important to me than his gratitude at an
acquittal would have been.

I am delighted at your news about the Hermathena. It is a most suitable
ornament for my Academy, since no class-room is complete without a
Hermes, and Minerva has a special appropriateness in mine. So please do
as you suggest and send as many ornaments as possible for the place. The
statues you sent before I have not seen yet. They are in my house at
Formiae, where I am just thinking of going. I’ll have them all brought
to my place at Tusculum, and, if that ever gets too full, I’ll begin
decorating Caieta. Keep your books and don’t despair of my making them
mine some day. If I ever do, I shall be the richest of millionaires and
shan’t envy any man his manors and meadows.

You, who know me so well, can guess better than anyone the grief I have
felt at the death of my cousin Lucius and the loss it means to me both
in my public and in my private life. He has always

alterius et moribus homini accidere possunt, ex illo accidebant. Quare
non dubito, quin tibi quoque id molestum sit, cum et meo dolore moveare
et ipse omni virtute officioque ornatissimum tuique et sua sponte et meo
sermone amantem adfinem amicumque amiseris.

Quod ad me scribis de sorore tua, testis erit tibi ipsa, quantae mihi
curae fuerit, ut Quinti fratris animus in eam esset is, qui esse
deberet. Quem cum esse offensiorem arbitrarer, eas litteras ad eum misi,
quibus et placarem ut fratrem et monerem ut minorem et obiurgarem ut
errantem. Itaque ex iis, quae postea saepe ab eo ad me scripta sunt,
confido ita esse omnia, ut et oporteat et velimus.

De litterarum missione sine causa abs te accusor. Numquam enim a
Pomponia nostra certior sum factus esse, cui dare litteras possem, porro
autem neque mihi accidit, ut haberem, qui in Epirum proficisceretur,
nequedum te Athenis esse audiebamus. De Acutiliano autem negotio quod
mihi mandaras, ut primum a tuo digressu Romam veni, confeceram; sed
accidit, ut et contentione nihil opus esset, et ut ego, qui in te satis
consilii statuerim esse, mallem Peducaeum tibi consilium per litteras
quam me dare. Etenim, cum multos dies aures meas Acutilio dedissem,
cuius sermonis genus tibi notum esse arbitror, non mihi grave duxi
scribere ad te de illius querimoniis, cum eas audire, quod erat
subodiosum, leve putassem. Sed abs te ipso, qui me accusas, unas mihi
scito litteras redditas esse, cum et otii ad scribendum plus et
facultatem dandi maiorem habueris.

been kindness itself to me, and has rendered me every service a friend
could. I am sure you too will feel it, partly out of sympathy with me,
and partly because you will miss a dear and valued friend and relative,
who was attached to you of his own accord and at my prompting.

You mention your sister. She herself will tell you the pains I have
taken to make my brother Quintus behave as he should to her. When I
thought he was a little annoyed, I wrote to him trying to smooth matters
down with him as a brother, to give him good advice as my junior and to
remonstrate with him as in error. Judging by all the letters I have had
from him since, I trust things are as they should be and as we wish them
to be.

You have no reason to complain of lack of letters from me, as Pomponia
has never let me know when there was a messenger to give them to.
Besides it has so happened that I have not had anyone starting for
Epirus and have not yet heard of your arrival at Athens. Acutilius’
business I settled according to your directions, as soon as ever I got
to Rome after your departure: but, as it happened, there was no hurry,
and, knowing I could trust your good judgement, I preferred Peducaeus to
advise you by letter rather than myself. It was not the bother of
writing you an account of his grievances that I shirked. I spent several
days listening to him, and you know his way of talking; and I did not
mind, though it was a bit of a bore. Though you grumble at me, I’ve only
had one letter from you, let me tell you, and you have had more time to
write and a better chance of sending letters than I’ve had.

You say, “if so and so is a little annoyed with

voluntate me statuere oportere. Quam si ad me perscripseris, intelleges
me neque diligentiorem esse voluisse, quam tu esses, neque
neglegentiorem fore, quam tu velis.

De Tadiana re mecum Tadius locutus est te ita scripsisse, nihil esse
iam, quod laboraretur, quoniam hereditas usu capta esset. Id mirabamur
te ignorare, de tutela legitima, in qua dicitur esse puella, nihil usu

best: but he is in a very odd mood. I’ve said all I could for you. I
think I ought to follow your wishes as to what special arguments I
should use. If you will write and tell me your wishes, you will find
that I did not wish to be more energetic than you were, nor will I be
less energetic than you wish.

In that matter about Tadius’ property, he tells me you have written him
that there is no necessity for him to trouble any more about it: the
property is his by right of possession. I wonder you forgot, that in the
case of legal wards—and that is what the girl is said to be—right of
possession does not count. I am glad you like your new purchase in
Epirus. Please carry out my commissions, and, as you suggest, buy
anything else you think suitable for my Tusculan villa, if it is no
trouble to you. It is the only place I find restful after a hard day’s
work. I am expecting my brother Quintus every day. Terentia has a bad
attack of rheumatism. She sends her love and best wishes to you and your
sister and mother: and so does my little darling Tullia. Take care of
yourself, and don’t forget me. Your devoted friend.

All’s well—as well as could be desired—at home. Quintus and I are
looking after your mother and sister. I’ve spoken to Acutilius. He says
his broker has not advised him, and is much surprised there should have
been such a fuss because he refused to guarantee that there should be no
further claims on you. The settlement that you have arranged about
Tadius’ affairs is, I am sure, very good news for him, and he is pleased
about it. That friend of mine, who is really quite a good soul and very
amiable to me, is exceedingly annoyed with you. When I know how deeply
you take it to heart, I may be able to lay my plans accordingly.

I have raised the £180[8] for L. Cincius for the statues of Megaric
marble, as you advised me. Those figures of Hermes in Pentelic marble
with bronze heads, about which you wrote, I have already fallen in love
with: so please send them and anything else that you think suits the
place, and my enthusiasm for such things, and your own taste—the more
the merrier, and the sooner the better—especially those you intend for
the Gymnasium and the colonnade. For my appreciation for art treasures
is so great that I am afraid most people will laugh at me, though I
expect encouragement from you. If none of Lentulus’ boats are coming,
put them on any ship you like. My little darling, Tullia, keeps asking
for your promised present and duns me as though I were answerable for
you. But I am going to deny my obligation rather than pay up.

Your letters are much too few and far between, considering that it is
much easier for you to find some one coming to Rome than for me to find
anyone going to Athens. Besides you can be surer that I am at Rome than
I can be that you are in Athens. The shortness of this letter is due to
my doubts as to your whereabouts. Not knowing for certain where you are,
I don’t want private correspondence to fall into a stranger’s hands.

I am awaiting impatiently the statues of Megaric marble and those of
Hermes, which you mentioned in your letter. Don’t hesitate to send
anything else of the same kind that you have, if it is fit for my

want especially are those that are fit for a Gymnasium. Lentulus

First I promise to patch up the quarrel between you and our friend, even
if I cannot quite make peace. I should have done it before of my own
accord: but now that I see from your note that you have set your heart
on it, I’ll give my mind to it and try harder than ever to win him over.
I would have you to know that he is very seriously annoyed with you:
but, as I cannot see any serious ground for his annoyance, I hope I
shall find him pliable and amenable to my influence.

Please do as you say about the statues and the Hermeraclae: and have
them shipped as soon as you can conveniently, and any other things you
come across that are suitable for the place—you know what it is
like—especially for the Palaestra and Gymnasium. That’s where I am
sitting and writing now, so my thoughts naturally run on it. I give you
a commission too for bas-reliefs for insertion in the stucco walls of
the hall, and for two well-covers in carved relief. Be sure you don’t
promise your library to anyone, however ardent a suitor you may find for
it. I am saving up all my little gleanings to buy it as a prop for my
old age.

My brother’s affairs are, I trust, as I have always wished them to be
and striven to make them. Everything points that way, and not the least
that your sister is enceinte. As for my election, I’ve not forgotten
that I gave you leave to stop away: and I’ve already warned our common
friends, who expect you to come, that I’ve not only forborne to ask you
to do so, but even forbidden it, knowing that present business is of
much more importance to you than your presence at my election would be
to me. I should like you to feel exactly as though it were my business

redoubled by the receipt of two letters from you insisting on the same
point. Besides Sallustius was continually pressing me to do my best to
replace you on your old friendly footing with Lucceius. But when I had
done the uttermost, I failed not only to win back his old affection for
you, but even to extract from him the reason for his change of feelings
towards you. Though he is continually harping on that arbitration case
of his, and the other things which I noticed provoked him when you were
here, there is something else, I am sure, which is rankling in his mind.
And this your presence, a talk with him, and still more the sight of
your familiar face, would do more to remove than either your letters or
my services as intermediary, if you think it worth while to come. And,
if you will listen to me and are disposed to act with your usual
courtesy, you will certainly think it worth while. You would never
believe how self-willed and stiff-necked he seems to be on the point: so
don’t be astonished that I now appear to doubt my ability to manage him,
though in former letters I hinted that I thought he would

Teucris[9] is an unconscionably slow coach and Cornelius has never come
back to Terentia: so I suppose I shall have to turn to Considius, Axius

less than 12 per cent. But to return to the point; Teucris’ behaviour is
the most shameless mixture of cunning and laziness I have ever seen.

circumstances I couldn’t honourably champion him. I should lose the
respect of both parties if I did: and what’s more, I wouldn’t, if I
could, in view of certain things that have happened, to which I should
like to call your attention. There’s a freedman of mine, an utter
scoundrel—Hilarus I mean—an accountant and a client of yours. Valerius
the interpreter sends me news of him, and Thyillus says he has heard too
that the fellow is with Antony, and that Antony, when he is making
requisitions, always asserts that part is levied on my authority, and
that I have sent a freedman to look after my share. I am considerably
annoyed, though I hardly believe the story: but there has been a good
deal of talk. Look into the matter thoroughly and try to get to the
bottom of it, and, if you possibly can, get that rascal shifted.
Valerius mentioned Cn. Plancius as his authority for the statement. I
leave the whole matter entirely in your hands to investigate.

I am assured that Pompey is on the best of terms with me. Mucia’s
divorce meets with every one’s approval. I expect you have heard that P.
Clodius, son of Appius, was discovered in woman’s clothes in C. Caesar’s
house, where the sacrifice was going on: but a servant girl managed to
smuggle him out. It has created a public scandal: and I am sure you will
be sorry to hear of it.

I don’t think I have any other news for you: and I’m sorry to say I’ve
been rather upset while writing. My reader Sositheus, a charming fellow,

I have had your three letters: one from M. Cornelius, to whom you gave
it, I think at the Three Taverns; another brought by your host at
Canusium; and a third which you say you posted from the boat just as you
got under weigh. All three of them were, as a pupil in the rhetorical
schools would say, at once sprinkled with the salt of refinement and
stamped with the brand of affection. They certainly provoke an answer:
but I have been rather slow about sending one, for lack of a safe
messenger. There are very few who can carry a letter of weight without
lightening it by a perusal. Besides, I don’t hear of every traveller to
Epirus. For I suppose, when you have offered sacrifice at your villa
Amalthea, you will start at once to lay siege to Sicyon. I’m not certain
either how or when you are going to join Antony or how long you will
stay in Epirus. So I dare not trust at all outspoken letters to people
going either to Achaia or to Epirus.

Plenty of things have happened worth writing about since your departure,
but I dared not commit them to the risk of the letters being either lost
or opened or intercepted. First then let me tell you I was not asked my
opinion first in the House, but had to play second fiddle to the
“peace-maker” of the

Allobroges.[13] Nor did I mind much, though the senate murmured
disapproval. It has freed me from the necessity of bowing to a crotchety
individual, and sets me at liberty to preserve my political dignity in
spite of him. The second place carries nearly as much weight with it as
the first, and one’s actions are not so much bound by obligation to the
consul. The third place fell to Catulus: the fourth, if you want to go
as far, to Hortensius. The consul is petty-minded and perverse, a
quibbler who used that bitter kind of sarcasm, which raises a laugh even
when there is no wit in the words, on the strength of his expression
rather than his expressions. He is no politician at all, he stands aloof
from the conservatives: and one cannot expect him to render any good
services to the state, because he does not wish to do so, nor any bad,
because he does not dare. But his colleague is most polite to me, a keen
politician and a bulwark of the conservative party. There is a slight
difference of opinion between them at present: but I am afraid that the
contagion may spread. No doubt you have heard that, when the sacrifice
was taking place in Caesar’s house, a man in woman’s clothes got in; and
that after the Vestal Virgins had performed the sacrifice afresh, the
matter was mentioned in the House by Cornificius. Note that he was the
prime mover and none of us. Then a resolution was passed, the matter was
referred to the Virgins and the priests, and they pronounced it a
sacrilege. So the consuls were directed by the House to bring in a bill
about it. Caesar has divorced his wife. Piso’s friendship

for Clodius is making him do his best to have the bill shelved, though
he is the person who has to bring it forward under the House’s
orders—and a bill for sacrilege too! Messalla at present takes a strict
view of the case. The conservatives are dropping out of it under
persuasion from Clodius. Gangs of rowdies are being formed. I, who at
first was a perfect Lycurgus, am daily cooling down. Cato, however, is
pressing the case with energy. But enough. I am afraid that what with
the lack of interest shown in the case by the conservatives, and its
championship by the socialists, it may cause a lot of mischief to the
state. Your friend[14]—you know whom I mean, the man who, you say, began
to praise me as soon as he feared to blame me—is now parading his
affection for me openly and ostentatiously; but in his heart of hearts
he is envious, and he does not disguise it very well. He is totally
lacking in courtesy, candour, in brilliancy in his politics, as well as
in sense of honour, resolution and generosity. But I’ll write more fully
about that another time. I’ve not got hold of the facts properly yet,
and I dare not trust an important letter to a man in the street like
this messenger.

The praetors have not drawn their provinces yet: and things are just as
they were when you left. I will insert a description of Misenum and
Puteoli in my speech as you suggest. I had already spotted the mistake

needs trot out Pompey to deliver an harangue. This happened in the
Circus Flaminius, where there was the usual market-day gathering of
riff-raff. Fufius asked him whether he agreed with the proposal that the
praetor should have the selection of the jurymen and then use them as
his panel. That of course was the plan proposed by the Senate in
Clodius’ trial for sacrilege. To this Pompey replied _en grand seigneur_
that he felt and always had felt the greatest respect for the Senate’s
authority; and very long-winded he was about it. Afterwards the consul
Messalla asked Pompey in the Senate for his opinion on the sacrilege and
the proposed bill. He delivered a speech eulogizing the Senate’s
measures _en bloc_, and said to me as he sat down at my side, that he
thought he had given a sufficiently clear answer to “those questions.”
Crassus no sooner saw that he had won public appreciation, because
people fancied that he approved of my consulship, than up he got and
spoke of it in the most complimentary way. He said that he owed his seat
in the House, his privileges as a citizen, his freedom and his very
life, to me. He never saw his wife’s face, or his home, or his native
land, without recognizing the debt he owed to me. But enough. He worked
up with great effect all that purple patch which I so often use here and
there to adorn my speeches, to which you play Aristarchus[16]—the
passage about fire and sword—you know the paints I have on my palette. I
was sitting next to Pompey, and noticed that he was much affected,
possibly at seeing Crassus

snap up the chance of winning popularity, which he had thrown away, and
perhaps at realizing the importance of my achievements, when he saw that
praise of them met with the Senate’s entire approval, especially coming
from one who had all the less necessity to praise me, because in every
one of my works he has been censured for Pompey’s benefit. To-day has
done a great deal to cement my friendship with Crassus: but still I
gladly received any crumbs Pompey let fall openly or covertly.[17] As
for me, ye gods, how I showed off before my new listener Pompey! Then,
if ever, my flow of rounded periods, my easy transitions, my antitheses,
my constructive arguments stood me in good stead. In a word, loud
applause! For the gist of it was the importance of the Senatorial order,
its unison with the knights, the concord of all Italy, the paralysed
remains of the conspiracy, peace and plenty. You know how I can thunder
on a subject like that. This time my thunders were so loud that I
forbear to say any more about them. I expect you heard them right over
there.

Well, there you have the news of the town. The Senate is a perfect
Areopagus, all seriousness, steadfastness and firmness. For when the
time came for passing the Senate’s measure, all those callow youths,
Catiline’s cubs, met under the leadership of Curio’s feminine son, and
asked the people to reject it. The consul Piso had to propose the law,

rostrum and giving Piso a slap in the face, if one can say “slap in the
face” of an utterance full of dignity, full of authority, and full of
saving counsel. Our friend Hortensius joined him too, and many other
loyalists, Favonius particularly distinguishing himself for his energy.
This rally of the conservatives broke up the meeting, and the Senate was
called together. In a full house a resolution was passed that persuasion
should be used to induce the people to accept the measure, though Piso
opposed it and Clodius went down on his knees to us one by one. Some
fifteen supported Curio’s rejection of the bill, while the opposite
party numbered easily 400. That settled the matter. Funfius the tribune
collapsed. Clodius delivered some pitiful harangues, in which he hurled
reproaches at Lucullus, Hortensius, C. Piso, and the consul Messalla: me
he only twitted with my sensational discoveries.[19] The Senate decided
that no action was to be taken as to the distribution of provinces among
the praetors, hearing of legations or anything else, till this measure
was passed.

There you have the political situation. But there is one piece of news I
must tell you, as it is better than I expected. Messalla is an excellent
consul, resolute, reliable and energetic: for me he expresses admiration
and respect, and shows it by imitating me. That other fellow has only
one redeeming vice, laziness, sleepiness, ignorance, and _fainéance_:
but at heart he is such a _mauvais sujet_ that he began to

at daggers drawn with all the patriotic party. It was not so much

You ask what can have happened about the trial to give it such an
unexpected ending, and you want to know, too, why I showed less fight
than usual. Well! In my answer I’ll put the cart before the horse like
Homer. So long as I had to defend the Senate’s decree, I fought so
fiercely and doughtily, that cheering crowds rallied round me
enthusiastic in my applause. You would certainly have marvelled at my
courage on this occasion, if ever you credited me with any courage in my
country’s defence. When Clodius fell back on speechifying and took my
name in vain, didn’t I just show fight, didn’t I deal havoc! How I
charged Piso, Curio, and all that crowd! Didn’t I rate the old men for
their frivolity, the young for their wanton passions! Heaven is my
witness, I often wanted you not only to prompt my plans, but also to be
a spectator of my doughty deeds. But when Hortensius had conceived the
idea of letting Fufius bring in his bill about the sacrilege, which only
differed from the consular measure in the method of choosing the
jury—though that was the point on which everything turned—and fought for
his own way, under the impression, which he had also conveyed to others,
that no conceivable

posse, contraxi vela perspiciens inopiam iudicum, neque dixi quicquam
pro testimonio, nisi quod erat ita notum atque testatum, ut non possem
praeterire. Itaque, si causam quaeris absolutionis, ut iam πρὸς τὸ
πρότερον revertar, egestas iudicum fuit et turpitudo. Id autem ut
accideret, commissum est Hortensi consilio, qui dum veritus est, ne
Fufius ei legi intercederet, quae ex senatus consulto ferebatur, non
vidit illud, satius esse illum in infamia relinqui ac sordibus quam
infirmo iudicio committi, sed ductus odio properavit rem deducere in
iudicium, cum illum plumbeo gladio iugulatum iri tamen diceret.

Sed iudicium si quaeris quale fuerit, incredibili exitu, sic uti nunc ex
eventu ab aliis, a me tamen ex ipso initio consilium Hortensi
reprehendatur. Nam, ut reiectio facta est clamoribus maximis, cum
accusator tamquam censor bonus homines nequissimos reiceret, reus
tamquam clemens lanista frugalissimum quemque secerneret, ut primum
iudices consederunt, valde diffidere boni coeperunt. Non enim umquam
turpior in ludo talario consessus fuit, maculosi senatores, nudi
equites, tribuni non tam aerati quam, ut appellantur, aerarii. Pauci
tamen boni inerant, quos reiectione fugare ille non potuerat, qui maesti

jury could acquit Clodius, I drew in a reef or two, not being blind to
the impecuniosity of the jurymen. I confined my testimony to points so
thoroughly well-known and attested that I could not omit them. So, to
come at last to the “horse,” if you want to know the reason for his
acquittal, it lay in the jury’s lack of pence and of conscience. But it
was Hortensius’ plan that made such a result possible. In his fright
that Fufius might veto the Senate’s measure, he overlooked the fact that
it would be better for Clodius to be kept in disgrace with a trial
hanging over his head, than for the case to come before an unsound
court. Spurred on by hatred, he rushed the matter into court, saying
that a leaden sword was sharp enough to cut Clodius’ throat.

If you want to know about the trial, the result of it was so incredible
that now after the event everybody agrees with my forebodings and blames
Hortensius. The challenging of the jury took place amidst an uproar,
since the prosecutor like a good censor rejected all the knaves, and the
defendant like a kind-hearted trainer of gladiators set aside all the
respectable people. And as soon as the jury took their seats, the
patriotic party began to have grave misgivings: for never did a more
disreputable set of people get together even in a gambling hell.
Senators with a past, knights without a penny, tribunes whose only right
to a title implying pay lay in their readiness to take it.[21] The few
honest folk among them, that he had not managed to remove in his
selection, sat as woe-begone as fish out of water,

tantum; nemo erat, qui illum reum ac non miliens condemnatum
arbitraretur. Me vero teste producto credo te ex acclamatione Clodi

sadly upset and bemoaning their contact with infamy. At the preliminary
proceedings, as point after point was put before the jury, their strict
and unanimous uprightness was extraordinary. The defendant never won a
point, and the prosecution were granted more than they asked for. It
goes without saying that Hortensius was triumphant at his penetration;
and no one regarded Clodius so much as a man on his trial as one that
had been condemned a thousand times over.

You have no doubt heard how the jury rose in a body to protect me, when
I stepped into the witness-box and Clodius’ supporters began to hoot:
and how they offered their throats to Clodius’ sword in defence of me.
Thereby, to my mind they paid me a far higher compliment than your
fellow-citizens paid Xenocrates, when they refused to let him take the
oath before giving his testimony, or our Roman jury paid Metellus
Numidicus, when they would not look at the accounts which he passed
round as is usual in such cases. I repeat, the honour shown me was far
greater. The shouts of the jury, proclaiming me as the saviour of the
country crushed and annihilated the defendant and all his supporters.
And on the next day a crowd as great as that which conducted me home at
the end of my consulship gathered round me. Our noble Areopagites
declared they would not come without a guard. The votes of the court
were taken, and there was only one person who voted a guard unnecessary.
The point was laid before the Senate, who passed a decree in the
strongest and most complimentary terms, thanking the jury and referring
the matter to the magistrates. No one thought Clodius would defend his
case. “Tell me [Sidenote: Iliad xvi, 112] now, ye Muses, how first the
fire fell.”

You know Baldpate of Nanneian fame,[22] my late panegyrist, whose
complimentary speech in my honour I have already mentioned in my
letters; well, he managed the whole job in a couple of days with the
help of one slave and that an ex-prizefighter. He sent for everybody,
made promises, gave security, paid money down. Good heavens, what a
scandal there was! Even the favours of certain ladies and introductions
to young men of good family were given to some of the jury to swell the
bribe. All honest men withdrew entirely from the case and the forum was
full of slaves. Yet five and twenty of the jury were brave enough to
risk their necks, preferring death to treachery: but there were
thirty-one who were more influenced by famine than fame. Catulus meeting
one of these latter remarked to him: “Why did you ask for a guard? For
fear of having your pocket picked?” There you have as short a summary as
possible of the trial and the reason for the acquittal.

You want to know next what is the present state of public affairs, and
how I am getting on. We thought that the condition of the Republic had
been set on a firm footing, you by my prudence, I by divine
interposition: and that its preservation was secured and established by
the combination of all patriots and by the influence of my consulship.

most worthless scoundrels in Rome have blotted out right and justice for
filthy lucre, and when Hodge and John a Nokes and Tom a Styles and all
the riff-raff of that description have declared a thing not to have
happened which every man—man did I say?—nay, every beast of the field,
knows for a fact. Still—to give you some consolation about politics—the
country has not received so serious a blow as traitors wished, nor is
iniquity vaunting itself so rampantly on its victory. For they clearly
thought that, when religious and moral scruples, judicial honour and the
Senate’s authority had been destroyed, iniquity and lust would triumph
openly, and would wreak their vengeance on all honest folk for the brand
that had been stamped on vice by my consulship. I was the man—I don’t
think I am boasting unduly in saying so to you privately, especially in
a letter which I would rather you didn’t read to anyone—I was the man
who revived the fainting courage of the patriots, encouraging and
cheering them one by one. I attacked and routed that venal jury; and I
did not leave the victorious party and its supporters a word to say for
themselves. The consul Piso I did not leave an inch to stand on. Syria,
which had been promised him as his province, I wrested from him. The
Senate I aroused from its despondency, recalling it to its former
uprightness. Clodius I bearded and crushed in the Senate with a set
speech full of dignity, and then with a cross-examination, of which I
will give you a taste. The rest would lose both its verve and its wit,
when the fire of battle is out, and the tug-of-war, as you Greeks call
it, past. When I entered the House on the 15th of May, and was asked for
my opinion, I discussed politics at length, and by a

happy inspiration introduced this passage: “The Senate must not be
crushed by a single blow, they must not be faint-hearted. The wound is
such that it cannot be disguised, yet it must not be feared, lest by our
fear we prove ourselves abject cowards, or by ignoring it, very fools.
Lentulus twice obtained an acquittal, and Catiline as often, and this is
the third criminal let loose on the country by a jury. But you are
mistaken, Clodius. The jury saved you for the gallows, not for public
life: their object was not to keep you in the country, but to keep you
from leaving it. Keep up your hearts, then, senators, and preserve your
dignity. The feelings of all patriots are unchanged; they have suffered
grief, but their courage is undiminished. It is no new disaster that has
befallen us, we have merely discovered one that existed unnoticed. The
trial of one villain has revealed many as guilty as himself.” But there,
I’ve nearly copied the whole speech. Now for our passage of arms. Up
gets this pretty boy and reproaches me with spending my time at Baiae.
It was a lie: and anyhow what did it matter? “One would think,” said I,
“you were accusing me of spending my time in hiding.” “What need has a
man of Arpinum to take the waters?” asks Clodius: and I answered: “You
should talk like that to your patron[24] who wanted to take the waters
of a man of Arpinum,”—you know about the sea-water baths. “How long are
we going to let this man king it over us?” says he. “I wonder you
mention the word king,” I replied, “since King[25] did not mention you.”

been dying to inherit Kind’s money. “You have bought a house,” he says.
“You seem to think it is the same as buying a jury,” I answer. “They did
not credit you on your oath,” he remarks. To which I answer:
“Twenty-five jurymen credited me: the other thirty-one gave you no
credit, but took care to get their money first.” There was loud
applause, and he collapsed without a word, utterly crushed.

My own position is this. I have retained the influence I had, when you
left, over the conservative party, and have gained much more influence
over the sordid dregs of the populace than I had then. That my testimony
was not accepted does me no harm. My unpopularity has been tapped like a
dropsy and painlessly reduced, and another thing has done me even more
good: the supporters of that crime confess that that open scandal was
due to bribery. Besides that blood-sucker of the treasury, the wretched
and starveling mob, thinks I am a prime favourite with the “great man”
Pompey, and upon my soul we are upon terms of very pleasant intimacy—so
much so indeed that these bottle-conspirators, these youths with budding
beards in common table-talk call him Gnaeus Cicero. So both at the games
and at the gladiatorial shows, I have been the object of extraordinary
demonstrations without hisses or catcalls.

Now every one is looking forward to the elections. Our “great” Pompey is
pushing Aulus’ son amidst general disapproval: and the means he is using
are neither authority nor influence, but those which Philip said, would
storm any fort to which an ass laden with money could climb. Piso is
said to be playing second fiddle to Pompey and to have bribery-agents

in his house: but I don’t believe it. But two decrees have been passed
on the proposal of Cato and Domitius, which are unpopular because they
are thought to be directed against the consul; one, making it lawful to
search the house of any magistrate, and the other making it a
treasonable offence to have bribery agents in one’s house. The tribune
Lurco, who entered on his office under another law,[28] has been freed
from the obligations of the Aelian and Fufian laws, so that he may
propose his law about bribery. He had luck in publishing it in spite of
his deformity. Accordingly the elections have been postponed till the
27th of July. The new point about this law is that a mere promise to
bribe the tribesmen counts for nothing, if it is not fulfilled; but, if
it is fulfilled, the man who made it is liable for life to a fine of
£27[29] per tribe. I remarked Clodius had kept this law before it was
passed: for he is always promising and not paying. But, I say, if he[30]
gets in, that consulship of mine which Curio used to call a deification
will become an absolute farce.[31] So, I suppose I must take to
philosophy

You write that you have made up your mind not to go to Asia. I would

not. But I cannot blame your determination, especially as I have refused
to go to a province.

I shall be contented with the inscriptions you have put in your
Amaltheum, especially as Thyillus has deserted me and Archias has not
written anything about me. I am afraid, now he has written his Greek
poem on the Luculli, he is turning to the Caecilian drama. I have
thanked Antonius on your behalf, and given that letter to Mallius. My
letters to you up to now have been fewer than they should have been, as
I had no trusty messenger nor any certain address to send them to. I
have sung your praises loudly. If Cincius delegates any of your business
to me, I will undertake it. But just at present he is more concerned
with his own, in which I am ready to assist him. Expect frequent letters
from me, if you are settled: and send me even more. Please write me a
description of your Amaltheum, its adornment and situation; and send me
any poems and tales you have about Amalthea. I should like to make one
too in my place at Arpinum. I will send you some of my writings: but
there is nothing finished.

Your letter and the enclosed copy of one of my brother Quintus’ letters
show me that he has continually changed his mind and wavered in his
opinion and judgement. I am exceedingly disturbed

adfectus, quantam mihi meus amor summus erga utrumque vestrum adferre
debuit, et admiratione, quidnam accidisset, quod adferret Quinto fratri
meo aut offensionem tam gravem aut commutationem tantam voluntatis.
Atque illud a me iam ante intellegebatur, quod te quoque ipsum
discedentem a nobis suspicari videbam, subesse nescio quid opinionis
incommodae sauciumque esse eius animum et insedisse quasdam odiosas
suspiciones. Quibus ego mederi cum cuperem antea saepe et vehementius
etiam post sortitionem provinciae, nec tantum intellegebam ei esse
offensionis, quantum litterae tuae declararant, nec tantum proficiebam,
quantum volebam. Sed tamen hoc me ipse consolabar, quod non dubitabam,
quin te ille aut Dyrrachi aut in istis locis uspiam visurus esset; quod
cum accidisset, confidebam ac mihi persuaseram fore ut omnia placarentur
inter vos non modo sermone ac disputatione, sed conspectu ipso
congressuque vestro. Nam quanta sit in Quinto fratre meo comitas, quanta
iucunditas, quam mollis animus et ad accipiendam et ad deponendam
offensionem, nihil attinet me ad te, qui ea nosti, scribere. Sed accidit
perincommode, quod eum nusquam vidisti. Valuit enim plus, quod erat illi
non nullorum artificiis inculcatum, quam aut officium aut necessitudo
aut amor vester ille pristinus, qui plurimum valere debuit. Atque huius
incommodi culpa ubi resideat, facilius possum existimare quam scribere;
vereor enim, ne, dum defendam meos, non parcam tuis. Nam sic intellego,
ut nihil a domesticis

about it, as indeed I could not help being, considering my affection for
both of you, and I wonder what can have happened to cause my brother
Quintus such grave offence and to make him change his mind so
extraordinarily. I grasped some time ago, what I think you were
beginning to suspect, when you left, that at the bottom of it must be
some idea of an insult, and that his feelings were wounded and some
unpleasant suspicions had taken deep root. Though I often before sought
to heal the wound, and redoubled my efforts after the allotment of his
province, I could neither find that he was as much annoyed as your
letter makes out, nor yet make as much headway with him as I wished.
However, I used to console myself with the thought that he would be sure
to see you either at Dyrrachium or somewhere thereabout. And I had quite
made up my mind that when that occurred, all the difficulties between
you would be smoothed over as much by the mere sight of one another and
the pleasure of meeting as by conversation and discussion. For I need
not tell you, who know it yourself, how amiable and kindly my brother
Quintus is, and how sensitive he is and ready both to take offence and
to forget it. But it has happened most unfortunately that you have not
seen him anywhere. For the impression he has received from some
designing persons has had more weight with him than either his duty or
your old intimacy and affection which ought to have had the greatest
weight of all. Where the blame for this unpleasantness rests, it is
easier for me to imagine than to write. For I am afraid that in
defending my relatives I may not spare yours. For my view is that, even
if no wound was inflicted

vulneris factum sit, illud quidem, quod erat, eos certe sanare potuisse.
Sed huiusce rei totius vitium, quod aliquanto etiam latius patet, quam
videtur, praesenti tibi commodius exponam. De iis litteris; quas ad te
Thessalonica misit, et de sermonibus, quos ab illo et Romae apud amicos
tuos et in itinere habitos putas, ecquid tantum causae sit, ignore, sed
omnis in tua posita est humanitate mihi spes huius levandae molestiae.
Nam, si ita statueris, et irritabiles animus esse optimorum saepe
hominum et eosdem placabiles et esse hanc agilitatem, ut ita dicam,
mollitiamque naturae plerumque bonitatis et, id quod caput est, nobis
inter nos nostra sive incommoda sive vitia sive iniurias esse
tolerandas, facile haec, quem ad modum spero, mitigabuntur; quod ego ut
facias te oro. Nam ad me, qui te unice diligo, maxime pertinet neminem
esse meorum, qui aut te non amet aut abs te non ametur.

Illa pars epistulae tuae minime fuit necessaria, in qua exponis, quas
facilitates aut provincialium aut urbanorum commodorum et aliis
temporibus et me ipso consule praetermiseris. Mihi enim perspecta est et
ingenuitas et magnitudo animi tui; neque ego inter me atque te quicquam
interesse umquam duxi praeter voluntatem institutae vitae, quod me
ambitio quaedam ad honorum studium, te autem alia minime reprehendenda
ratio ad honestum otium duxit. Vera quidem laude probitatis,
diligentiae, religionis neque me tibi neque quemquam antepono, amoris
vero erga

by members of the family, they could certainly have healed the one which
existed. But the real fault of the whole matter, which is of rather
wider extent than it appears, I can explain to you more conveniently
when we meet. As to the letter which he sent to you from Thessalonica
and the language which you think he used about you both to your friends
at Rome and on his journey, I cannot see any sufficient cause for them;
but all my hope of removing this unpleasantness lies in your kindness.
For if you can persuade yourself that the best of men are often those
whose feelings are easy to arouse and easy to appease, and that this
nimbleness, if I may use the word, and sensitiveness of disposition are
generally signs of a good heart, and—what is the main point—that we must
put up with one another’s unpleasantnesses and faults and insults, then,
as I hope, all this can be smoothed over easily. This I beg of you to
do. For, as I hold you in such peculiar esteem, it is my dearest wish
that there may not be any of my people who either does not love you or
is not loved by you.

That part of your letter in which you mention the chances of preferment
in the provinces or in town, which you neglected in my consulship and at
other times, was most unnecessary, for I am thoroughly persuaded of your
disinterestedness and magnanimity, and I have never thought that there
was any difference between you and me, except our choice of a career. A
touch of ambition led me to seek for distinction, while another
perfectly laudable motive led you to honourable ease. But in the real
glory which consists in uprightness, industry and piety, there is no one
I place above you, not even myself, and as

me, cum a fraterno amore domesticoque discessi, tibi primas defero. Vidi
enim, vidi penitusque perspexi in meis variis temporibus et
sollicitudines et laetitias tuas. Fuit mihi saepe et laudis nostrae
gratulatio tua iucunda et timoris consolatio grata. Quin mihi nunc te
absente non solum consilium, quo tu excellis, sed etiam sermonis
communicatio, quae mihi suavissima tecum solet esse, maxime deest—quid
dicam? in publicane re, quo in genere mihi neglegenti esse non licet, an
in forensi labore, quem antea propter ambitionem sustinebam, nunc, ut
dignitatem tueri gratia possim, an in ipsis domesticis negotiis, in
quibus ego cum antea tum vero post discessum fratris te sermonesque
nostros desidero? Postremo non labor meus, non requies, non negotium,
non otium, non forenses res, non domesticae, non publicae, non privatae
carere diutius tuo suavissimo atque amantissimo consilio ac sermone
possunt.

Atque harum rerum commemorationem verecundia saepe impedivit utriusque
nostrum; nunc autem ea fuit necessaria propter eam partem epistulae
tuae, per quam te ac mores tuos mihi purgatos ac probatos esse voluisti.
Atque in ista incommoditate alienati illius animi et offensi illud inest
tamen commodi, quod et mihi et ceteris amicis tuis nota fuit et abs te
aliquanto ante testificata tua voluntas omittendae provinciae, ut, quod
una non estis, non dissensione ac discidio vestro, sed voluntate ac
iudicio tuo factum esse videatur. Quare et illa, quae violata,
expiabuntur,

regards affection to myself, after my brother and my immediate
connections, I give you the palm. For I have seen time after time, and
have had thorough experience of your sorrow and your joy in my changing
fortunes. I have often had the pleasure of your congratulations in times
of triumph and the comfort of your consolation in hours of despondency.
Nay at this very moment your absence makes me feel the lack not only of
your advice, which you excel in giving, but of the interchange of
speech, which I enjoy most with you. I hardly know if I miss it most in
politics, where I dare not make a slip; or in my legal work, which I
used to undertake for advancement’s sake and now keep up to preserve my
position through popularity; or in my private concerns. In all of them I
have felt your loss all along and especially since my brother’s
departure. Finally, neither my work nor my recreation, neither my
business nor my leisure, neither my legal affairs nor my domestic, my
public life or my private, can do without your most agreeable and
affectionate advice and conversation any longer.

The modesty of both of us has often prevented me from mentioning these
facts: but now it was forced upon me by that part of your letter in
which you say you want yourself and your character cleared and
vindicated in my eyes. There is one good thing as regards the
unpleasantness caused by his alienation and anger, that your
determination not to go to the province was known to me and other
friends of yours, as you told us some time before; so the fact that you
are not with him cannot be attributed to your quarrel and rupture, but
to your choice and plans already fixed. So amends will be made for

the breach of friendship; and the ties between us, which have been so
religiously preserved, will retain their inviolability.

The political position here is wretched, rotten and unstable. I expect
you have heard that our friends the knights have almost had a rupture
with the Senate. The first point that seriously annoyed them was the
publication of a senatorial decree for an investigation into any cases
of bribery of jurymen. As I did not happen to be present when the decree
was passed, and noticed that the knights were annoyed though they did
not openly say so, I remonstrated with the Senate very impressively, I
think, and spoke with great weight and fluency, considering how
shameless the case was. Here is another intolerable piece of petulance
on the part of the knights! Yet I have not only put up with it, but
forwarded their cause. The people who farmed the province of Asia from
the censors, complained in the Senate that their avariciousness had led
them to pay too high a price for it, and requested to have the lease
annulled. I was their chief supporter, or rather the second, for it was
Crassus who encouraged them to venture on the demand. It is a scandalous
affair, a disgraceful request and a confession of foolhardiness. There
was considerable danger, that, if they met with a refusal, they might
have severed their connection with the Senate entirely. In this case too
I was the main person who came to the rescue, and obtained for them a
hearing in a very full and friendly House, and discoursed freely on the
dignity and harmony of the two orders both on the first of December and
the following day. The matter is not yet settled: but the Senate’s
inclination is clear. For one person

am keeping to our policy and plan, and am preserving to the best of my
ability that harmony which I have welded: but still, as that is now in
such a shaky condition, I am, I hope, keeping a road open to preserve my
position. I cannot explain fully in a letter; but I will give you a
gentle hint. I am on the best of terms with Pompey. You know what I
mean. I will take all reasonable precautions, and will write again at
fuller length as to my plans for managing the republic.

Lucceius is thinking of standing for the consulship at once: for only
two candidates are spoken of as likely to come forward. With Caesar he
thinks he may come to terms through Arrius, and Bibulus’ cooperation he
hopes to win through C. Piso. You smile? There is nothing to laugh at, I
assure you. Is there anything else I want to tell you? Anything else?
Yes, lots of things, but another time ... you wish to wait (?), let me

little daughter and darling boy. For my grand and showy friendships
bring some public _éclat_, but private satisfaction they have none. And
so, when my house has been crowded with the morning _levée_ and I have
gone down to the forum amid a throng of friends, I cannot find in the
whole company a single man with whom I can jest freely or whisper
familiarly. So I look forward with longing to your coming and in fact
urge you to hurry: for I have many cares and anxieties, which I fancy
would be banished by a single walk and talk in your sympathetic hearing.

However, I will conceal the stings and pricks of my private troubles,
and will not entrust them to this letter and an unknown messenger. They
are not very grievous—so don’t alarm yourself—but still they are
persistent and worrying, and I have no friend’s advice and discussion to
lull them to rest. For the State, though there is still life in it, the
very cures that have been tried on it, have again and again opened fresh
wounds. If I were to give you a brief summary of what has happened since
you left, you would certainly exclaim that Rome cannot possibly stand
any longer. For it was after your departure, I believe, that the opening
scene of the

ut opinor, introitus fuit in causam fabulae Clodianae, in qua ego
nactus, ut mihi videbar, locum resecandae libidinis et coercendae
iuventutis; vehemens fui et omnes profudi vires animi atque ingenii mei
non odio adductus alicuius, sed spe corrigendae et sanandae civitatis.
Adflicta res publica est empto constupratoque iudicio. Vide, quae sint
postea consecuta. Consul est impositus is nobis, quem nemo praeter nos
philosophos aspicere sine suspiritu posset. Quantum hoc vulnus! facto
senatus consulto de ambitu, de iudiciis nulla lex perlata, exagitatus
senatus, alienati equites Romani. Sic ille annus duo firmamenta rei
publicae per me unum constituta evertit; nam et senatus auctoritatem
abiecit et ordinum concordiam diiunxit. Instat hic nunc ille annus
egregius. Eius initium eius modi fuit, ut anniversaria sacra Iuventatis
non committerentur; nam M. Luculli uxorem Memmius suis sacris initiavit;
Menelaus aegre id passus divortium fecit. Quamquam ille pastor Idaeus
Menelaum solum contempserat, hic noster Paris tam Menelaum quam
Agamemnonem liberum non putavit. Est autem C. Herennius quidam tribunus
pl., quem tu fortasse ne nosti quidem; tametsi potes nosse, tribulis
enim tuus est, et Sextus, pater eius, nummos vobis dividere solebat. Is
ad plebem P. Clodium traducit, idemque fert, ut universus populus in
campo Martio suffragium de re Clodi ferat. Hunc

Clodian drama became the topic of discussion. There I thought I had a
chance of using the surgeon’s knife on licentiousness and curbing
youthful excesses: and I exerted myself, putting forth all the resources
of my intellect and mind, not out of private spite, but in the hope of
effecting a radical cure of the State. The corruption of the jury by
bribery and debauchery dealt a crushing blow to the republic. See what
has followed. We have had a consul forced on us, at whom no one except
us philosophers can look without a sigh. That is a fatal stroke. Though
a senatorial decree has been passed about the bribery of juries, no law
has been carried; the Senate has been frightened out of it, and the
knights have been estranged. So this one year has overturned two
bulwarks of the State which had been erected by me alone: for it has
destroyed the prestige of the Senate and broken up the harmony of the
orders. Now comes this precious year. It was inaugurated by the
suspension of the annual rites of the goddess of youth: for Memmius
initiated M. Lucullus’ wife into some rites of his own. Menelaus took it
hard and divorced his wife. Unlike the shepherd of Ida, who only
slighted Menelaus, our modern Paris thought Agamemnon[36] as fitting an
object for his contempt. There is one C. Herennius, a tribune—you may
not even know him, though perhaps you do, as he is a member of the same
tribe as yourself, and his father Sextus used to distribute money to
your tribesmen—he is trying to transfer P. Clodius to the plebs, and
even proposes that the whole people shall vote on the matter in the
Campus Martius. I gave him my

usual reception in the Senate; but he is the most phlegmatic of mortals.
Metellus is an excellent consul and an admirer of mine; but he has
lessened his influence by making, only for form’s sake, the very same
proposal about Clodius. But Aulus’ son—heavens above! what a cowardly
and spiritless wretch for a soldier! Just fit to be exposed, as he is,
to the daily abuse of Palicanus. An agrarian law has been proposed by
Flavius,—a very paltry production, almost identical with the Plotian
law. And in the meantime not the ghost of a real statesman is to be
found. The man who could be one, my intimate friend—for so he is, I
would have you to know—Pompey, wraps that precious triumphal cloak of
his around him in silence. Crassus never utters a word to risk his
popularity. The others you know well enough—fools who seem to hope that
their fish-ponds may be saved, though the country go to rack and ruin.
There is one who can be said to take some pains, but, according to my
view, with more constancy and honesty than judgement and ability—Cato.
It is now three months that he has been worrying those wretched
tax-collectors, who used to be great friends of his, and won’t let the
Senate give them an answer. So we are forced to suspend all decrees on
other subjects until the tax-collectors have had an answer. And I
suppose even the embassies[37] will have to be postponed for the same
reason.

If I had as much time as you have, or if I could bring myself to write
such short letters as you generally write, I could beat you hollow and
write far more frequently than you write. But on the top of my
inconceivable stress of work, you have to add my habit of never sending
you a letter without a theme and a moral. First, as one ought to a loyal
citizen, I will give you a sketch of political events, and then, as I am
the nearest in your affection, I will tell you any of my own affairs
that I think you would not be disinclined to know.

In politics then at the present minute fears of war in Gaul are the main
topic: for “our brothers” the Aedui have had a disastrous battle
recently, and the Helvetii are undoubtedly in arms and making raids on
our province. The Senate has decreed that the consuls should cast lots
for the two Gauls, that levies should be made, furloughs cancelled, and
ambassadors with full powers sent to visit the Gallic states and prevent
them from joining the Aedui. The ambassadors are Quintus Metellus
Creticus, and Lucius Flaccus, and—“the caper sauce on

Clodiani filius. Atque hoc loco illud non queo praeterire, quod, cum de
consularibus mea prima sors exisset, una voce senatus frequens

duo quasi pignora rei publicae retineri videremur. Quid enim ego aliorum
in me ἐπιφωνήματα exspectem, cum haec domi nascantur?

Urbanae autem res sic se habent. Agraria lex a Flavio tribuno pl.
vehementer agitabatur auctore Pompeio; quae nihil populare habebat
praeter auctorem. Ex hac ego lege secunda contionis voluntate omnia illa
tollebam, quae ad privatorum incommodum pertinebant, liberabam agrum
eum, qui P. Mucio, L. Calpurnio consulibus publicus fuisset, Sullanorum
hominum possessiones confirmabam, Volaterranos et Arretinos, quorum
agrum Sulla publicarat neque diviserat, in sua possessione retinebam;
unam rationem non reiciebam, ut ager hac adventicia pecunia emeretur,
quae ex novis vectigalibus per quinquennium reciperetur. Huic toti
rationi agrariae senatus adversabatur suspicans Pompeio novam quandam
potentiam quaeri; Pompeius vero ad voluntatem perferendae legis

lenten fare”[40]—Lentulus, son of Clodianus. And I cannot forbear adding
here that when my lot came up first in the ballot among the ex-consuls,
the Senate were unanimous in declaring that I should be kept in Rome.
The same happened to Pompey after me, so that we two appear to be kept
as pledges of the State. Why should I look for the “bravos” of strangers
when these triumphs bloom for me at home?

Well, this is the state of affairs in the city. The agrarian law was
zealously pushed by the tribune Flavius with the support of Pompey,
though its only claim to popularity was its supporter. My proposal to
remove from the law any points which encroached on private rights was
favourably received by a public meeting. I proposed to exempt from its
action such land as was public in the consulship of P. Mucius and L.
Calpurnius,[41] to confirm Sulla’s veterans in their possessions, to
allow the people of Volaterra and Arretium to retain in their holding
their land which Sulla had made public land, but had not distributed:
the only clause I did not reject was that land should be purchased by
this wind-fall which will come in from the new foreign revenues in the
next five years. The Senate was opposed to the whole agrarian scheme,
suspecting that Pompey was aiming at getting some new powers. Pompey had
set his heart on carrying the law through. I on the other hand, with the
full approval of the applicants for land, was for securing the holdings
of all private

possessiones; is enim est noster exercitus, hominum, ut tute scis,
locupletium; populo autem et Pompeio (nam id quoque volebam) satis
faciebam emptione, qua constituta diligenter et sentinam urbis exhauriri
et Italiae solitudinem frequentari posse arbitrabar. Sed haec tota res
interpellata bello refrixerat. Metellus est consul sane bonus et nos
admodum diligit; ille alter nihil ita est, ut plane, quid emerit,
nesciat. Haec sunt in re publica, nisi etiam illud ad rem publicam putas
pertinere, Herennium quendam, tribunum pl., tribulem tuum sane hominem
nequam atque egentem, saepe iam de P. Clodio ad plebem traducendo agere
coepisse. Huic frequenter interceditur. Haec sunt, ut opinor, in re
publica.

Ego autem, ut semel Nonarum illarum Decembrium iunctam invidia ac
multorum inimicitiis eximiam quandam atque immortalem gloriam consecutus
sum, non destiti eadem animi magnitudine in re publica versari et illam
institutam ac susceptam dignitatem tueri, sed, posteaquam primum Clodi
absolutione levitatem infirmitatemque iudiciorum perspexi, deinde vidi
nostros publicanos facile a senatu diiungi, quamquam a me ipso non
divellerentur, tum autem beatos homines, hos piscinarios dico amicos
tuos, non obscure nobis invidere, putavi mihi maiores quasdam opes et
firmiora praesidia esse quaerenda. Itaque primum, eum qui nimium diu de
rebus nostris tacuerat. Pompeium

persons—for, as you know, the strength of our party consists in the rich
landed gentry—while at the same time I fulfilled my desire to satisfy
Pompey and the populace by supporting the purchase of land, thinking
that, if that were thoroughly carried out, the city might be emptied of
the dregs of the populace, and the deserted parts of Italy peopled. But
the matter has cooled off now this war has interrupted it. Metellus is
an excellent consul and a great admirer of mine. The other one is an
utter nonentity and clearly bought a pig in a poke when he got the
consulship. That is all my political news, unless you think this has a
bearing on politics. One Herennius, a tribune and fellow tribesman of
yours, and a man of no character or position, has begun frequently
proposing the transference of P. Clodius from a patrician to a plebeian;
and his proposals are vetoed by many of his colleagues. This, I think,
is all the public news.

For myself, ever since that December day when I won such splendid and
immortal glory, though it carried with it much envy and enmity, I have
not ceased to employ the same high-minded policy and to keep the
position I have won and taken up. But, as soon as the acquittal of
Clodius showed me the uncertainty and instability of the law courts, and
I saw too how easily our friends the tax-gatherers could be estranged
from the Senate, though they might not sever their connection with me,
while the well-to-do—your friends with the fish-ponds, I mean—took no
pains to disguise their envy of me, I bethought me that I had better
look out for some stronger support and more secure protection. So
firstly I brought Pompey, the man who had held his peace too long about

testimonium, aut ita dubiae, ut laudationem desiderent) quam rei

cum Pompeio ex rerum illarum dissensione arbitrarentur. Cum hoc ego me

my achievements, into a frame of mind for attributing to me the
salvation of the empire and the world not once only, but time after time
and with emphasis in the House. That was not so much for my own
benefit—for my achievements were neither so obscure that they required
evidence, nor so dubious that they required puffing up—but for the
State’s sake, for there were some ill-natured persons who thought that
there was a certain amount of disagreement between Pompey and myself,
owing to a difference of opinion about those matters. With him I have
formed such an intimate connection that both of us are strengthened in
our policy and surer in our political position through our coalition.
The dislike which had been aroused against me among our dissipated and
dandified youths has been smoothed away by my affability, and now they
pay me more attention than anyone. In short I avoid hurting anyone’s
feelings, though I do not court popularity by relaxing my principles;
indeed my whole conduct is regulated so, that, while I preserve my
firmness in public life, in my private affairs the weakness of the loyal
party, the prejudice of the disaffected and the hostility of the
disloyal makes me move with some care and caution, and, involved though
I am in my new friendships, I frequently have the refrain of Epicharmus,
that subtle Sicilian, ringing in my ears:

             Be sober of head, and mistrustful of friends;
             Hinges are these on which wisdom depends.

was passed by the enthusiasm of the silent members[42] without any
support from our party. For as to my signature which you find attached
to it, you can see from the decree itself that it was quite a different
matter which was brought forward, and this clause about the free peoples
was added without rhyme or reason. It was the work of P. Servilius the
younger, who was one of the last to speak: but it cannot be altered at
the present time. So the meetings which at first were held about it have
ceased long ago. If, however, you should manage to squeeze a few pence
out of the Sicyonians, please let me know.

I have sent you a copy of my account of my consulship in Greek. If there
is anything in it, which to your Attic taste seems bad Greek or
unscholarly, I will not say what Lucullus said to you—at Panhormus, I
think—about his history, that he had interspersed a few barbarisms and
solecisms as a clear proof that it was the work of a Roman. If there is
anything of the kind in my work, it is there without my knowledge and
against my will. When I have finished the Latin version, I will send it
to you. In the third place you may expect a poem, not to let slip any
method of singing my own praises. Please don’t quote “Who will praise
his sire?”[43] For if there is any more fitting subject for eulogy, then
I am willing to be blamed for not choosing some other subject. However
my compositions are not panegyrics at all but histories.

On my return from my villa at Pompeii on the 12th of May, our friend
Cincius passed on to me your letter which was dated the 13th of
February. That is the letter which I shall now answer. And first I must
say how delighted I am that you fully understood my opinion of you: next
how very glad I am that you showed such forbearance with regard to the
slights and unkindness which in my opinion you had received from me and
mine: and I count it a sign of affection more than ordinary and the
highest sense and wisdom. Indeed your answer is so charmingly worded and
with such consideration and kindliness that not only have I no further
right to press you, but I can never expect to experience such courtesy
and forbearance from you or any other man. So I think it would be best
for me to say no more about the matter in my letters. If any point
arises, we will discuss it together when we meet.

Your remarks about politics are couched in friendly and prudent terms,
and your view does not differ from my own—for I must not withdraw from
my dignified position, nor must I enter another’s lines without any
forces of my own, and the man you mention has no broad-mindedness and no
high-mindedness,

nothing in him that is not low and time-serving. Well, perhaps the
course I took was not opposed to my own advantage and peace of life, but
I swear it was far more to the advantage of the State than to mine that
I should be the means of suppressing the attacks of the disloyal, and of
strengthening the wavering policy of a man of the highest position,
influence and popularity, and converting him from pandering to the
disloyal to approval of my achievements. If I had had to make any
sacrifice of principle in so doing, I should never have thought it
justifiable: but I managed it so that he seemed to gain in principle by
his approval of me, more than I lost in bowing to him. I will take care
that my actions now and in the future do not convey the impression that
what I did in the past was done at haphazard. My honest comrades, at
whom you hint, and the lot[44] which has fallen to me, as you say, I
will never desert. Nay, even if I am deserted by it I will abide by my
ancient principles. But I would have you please remember that, since the
death of Catulus, I am holding the way for the conservative party
without a garrison and without a comrade. For, as Rhinton, I think it
is, says:

           Some are stark naught, and naught do others reck.

How our friends of the fish-ponds envy me, I will either tell you in
another letter, or keep it till we meet. But from the Senate house
nothing shall tear me: either because that is the right course, or

Metellus tuus est egregius consul; unum reprehendo, quod otium nuntiari

Nunc, ut ad rem meam redeam, L. Papirius Paetus, vir bonus amatorque

because it is most consistent with my position, or because I am by no
means dissatisfied with the Senate’s estimation of me.

As regards the Sicyonians, there is very little hope to be placed in the
Senate, as I wrote you before: for there is no one now to raise a
complaint. It would be tedious to wait for them to move. Fight the point
in some other way, if you can. When the law was passed, nobody noticed
to whom it applied, and the dummy members plumped eagerly in its favour.
The time has not yet come for rescinding the decree, because there is no
one who complains about it, and some favour it, partly from spite and
partly from an idea of its justness.

Your friend Metellus is an excellent consul: I have only one fault to
find with him, he is not at all pleased with the news of peace from
Gaul. I take it he wants a triumph. I wish he would moderate that
desire: in every other way he is excellent. The behaviour of Aulus’s son
makes his consulship not a consulship, but a blot on the scutcheon[45]
of our friend Pompey.

I have sent you one of my works, a history of my consulship in Greek. I
have given it to L. Cossinius. I fancy you like my Latin work, but,
being a Greek, envy this Greek one. If others write about it, I will
send you copies; but I assure you, as soon as they read mine, they
somehow or other don’t hurry themselves about it.

Now to return to business. L. Papirius Paetus, my good friend and
admirer, has offered me the books left to him by Ser. Claudius: and, as
your friend Cincius said I could take them without breaking the

friends, clients, guests, freedmen, nay even your slaves, to see that
not a leaf is lost. For I have urgent necessity for the Greek works,
which I suspect, and the Latin books, which I am sure, he left. Every
day I seek my recreation, in such time as is left me from my legal
labours, more and more in such studies. You will do me the greatest of
favours, if you will show the same zeal in this as you generally do in
matters about which you think I am really keen. Paetus’ own affairs I
recommend to your notice too, and he expresses his deepest gratitude.
And I do more than ask you, I urge you, to pay me a visit soon.

[Sidenote: _Rome, June_, B.C. _60_]

On the 1st of June I met your boy as I was on my way to Antium and glad
to get away from M. Metellus’s gladiatorial exhibition. He delivered
your letter, and a memorial of my consulship written in Greek. I felt
very glad that I gave L. Cossinius the book I had written in Greek on
the same subject to take to you some time ago. For, if I had read yours
first you would say that I had plagiarized from you. Though yours (which
I read with pleasure) seemed to me a trifle rough and unadorned, yet its
very lack of ornament is an ornament in itself, just as women were
thought to have the best scent who used no scent. My book, on the other
hand, has exhausted all the scent box of Isocrates, and all the
rouge-pots of his pupils, and some of Aristotle’s colours too. You
scanned it through, as you tell me in another letter, at Corcyra, before
you had received it from Cossinius, I suppose. I should never have dared
to send it to you, if I had not revised it with leisure and care. I sent
the memoir to Posidonius too, asking him to write something more
elaborate on the same subject; but he tells me that, far from being
inspired to write by the perusal of it, he was decidedly put off. In
fact, I have flabbergasted the whole Greek nation: so I have ceased to
be plagued by the people who were always hanging about asking me to give
them something of mine to polish up. If you like the

liber, curabis, ut et Athenis sit et in ceteris oppidis Graeciae;
videtur enim posse aliquid nostris rebus lucis adferre. Oratiunculas
autem, et quas postulas, et plures etiam mittam, quoniam quidem ea, quae
nos scribimus adulescentulorum studiis excitati, te etiam delectant.
Fuit enim mihi commodum, quod in eis orationibus, quae Philippicae
nominantur, enituerat civis ille tuus Demosthenes, et quod se ab hoc
refractariolo iudiciali dicendi genere abiunxerat, ut σεμνότερός τις καὶ
πολιτικώτερος videretur, curare, et meae quoque essent orationes, quae
consulares nominarentur. Quarum una est in senatu Kal. Ianuariis, altera
ad populum de lege agraria, tertia de Othone, quarta pro Rabirio, quinta
de proscriptorum filiis, sexta, cum provinciam in contione deposui,
septima, cum Catilinam emisi, octava, quam habui ad populum, postridie
quam Catilina profugit, nona in contione, quo die Allobroges indicarunt,
decima in senatu Nonis Decembribus. Sunt praeterea duae breves, quasi
ἀποσπασμάτια legis agrariae. Hoc totum σῶμα curabo ut habeas; et,
quoniam te cum scripta tum res meae delectant, isdem ex libris
perspicies, et quae gesserim et quae dixerim; aut ne poposcisses; ego
enim tibi me non offerebam.

Quod quaeris, quid sit, quo te arcessam, ac simul impeditum te negotiis
esse significas neque recusas, quin, non modo si opus sit, sed etiam si
velim, accurras, nihil sane est necesse, verum tamen videbare mihi
tempora peregrinationis commodius posse discribere. Nimis abes diu,
praesertim cum sis in propinquis

book, you will see to it that Athens and other Greek towns have it in
stock; for I think it may add some lustre to my achievements. I will
send you the bits of speeches you ask for and some more too, as you find
some interest in things which I write to satisfy young admirers. Your
fellow-citizen, Demosthenes, gained a reputation by the speeches called
the Philippics, in which he departed from the quibbling style of
pleading we use in the law-courts, and appeared in the role of a serious
politician. So I took a fancy to leave behind me also some speeches
which may be called consular. One was delivered in the House on the 1st
of January, another to the people on the agrarian law, the third on
Otho, the fourth for Rabirius, the fifth for the sons of the proscribed,
the sixth when I declined a province in a public assembly, the seventh
when I drove Catiline out, the eighth before the people the day after
Catiline fled, the ninth in an assembly on the day when the Allobroges
gave their information, the tenth in the House on the 5th of December.
There are two more short ones, mere scraps of the agrarian law. I will
see that you have the whole _corpus_; and, since both my writing and my
achievements interest you, you will see from them what I have done, and
what I have written. Or else you should not have asked for them: I was
not the one to obtrude them.

You inquire why I ask you to come back, and hint that you are hindered
by business. Still you don’t refuse to come, if there is any need, or
even if I wish it. There is no real necessity; but it does seem to me
that you could arrange your times for going away more conveniently. You
are away too long, especially when you are quite near, and

locis, neque nos te fruimur, et tu nobis cares. Ac nunc quidem otium
est, sed, si paulo plus furor Pulchelli progredi posset, valde ego te
istim excitarem. Verum praeclare Metellus impedit et impediet. Quid
quaeris? est consul φιλόπατρις et, ut semper iudicavi, natura bonus.
Ille autem non simulat, sed plane tribunus pl. fieri cupit. Qua de re
cum in senatu ageretur, fregi hominem et inconstantiam eius reprehendi,
qui Romae tribunatum pl. peteret, cum in Sicilia hereditatem se petere
dictitasset, neque magno opere dixi esse nobis laborandum, quod nihilo
magis ei liciturum esset plebeio rem publicam perdere, quam similibus
eius me consule patriciis esset licitum. Iam, cum se ille septimo die
venisse a freto, neque sibi obviam quemquam prodire potuisse, et noctu
se introisse dixisset, in eoque se in contione iactasset, nihil ei novi
dixi accidisse. “Ex Sicilia septimo die Romam; ante tribus horis Roma
Interamnam. Noctu introisse; idem ante. Non est itum obviam; ne tum
quidem, cum iri maxime debuit.” Quid quaeris? hominem petulantem
modestum reddo non solum perpetua gravitate orationis, sed etiam hoc
genere dictorum. Itaque iam familiariter cum ipso cavillor ac iocor;
quin etiam, rum candidatum deduceremus, quaerit ex me, num consuessem
Siculis locum gladiatoribus dare. Negavi. “At ego,” inquit, “novus

so I have no chance of enjoying your society and you lack mine. Just at
present things are peaceful: but if that little beauty[47] should be
strong enough to indulge in any wilder freaks I should certainly be
routing you out of your retreat. However, Metellus is holding him in
nobly and will continue to do so. Most assuredly he is a thoroughly
patriotic consul, and, as I always thought, an excellent fellow. Clodius
does not beat about the bush, he is quite plainly aiming at the
tribunate. When the point was discussed in the Senate, I sat on him,
accusing him of inconsistency, for seeking the tribunate now in Rome,
when in Sicily he did nothing but repeat that what he wanted was an
inheritance. However, I added, we need not put ourselves about on that
point, as he would not be allowed to ruin the country if he becomes a
plebeian any more than patricians of his kidney were allowed to in my
consulship. Then, when he said he had come from the straits in a week,
so that no one could go to meet him, and had entered the city at night,
and boasted of the fact in a public speech, I said there was nothing new
in that. “Seven days from Sicily to Rome: the other time three hours
from Rome to Interamna. He came in at night: so he did before. No one
met him now: nor did anyone meet him last time, when they certainly
ought to have done so.” In fact, I am taking the cheek out of him, not
only by serious set speeches, but by quips of this kind too. So nowadays
I bandy jests and banter with him quite familiarly. For instance, when
we were escorting a candidate, he asked me whether I used to give the
Sicilians seats at the gladiatorial shows. I said, “No.” “Well,” said
he,

patronus instituam; sed soror, quae tantum habeat consularis loci, unum
mihi solum pedem dat.” “Noli,” inquam “de uno pede sororis queri; licet
etiam alterum tollas.” Non consulare, inquies, dictum. Fateor; sed ego
illam odi male consularem. “Ea est enim seditiosa, ea cum viro bellum
gerit” neque solum cum Metello, sed etiam cum Fabio, quod eos[48] in hoc
esse moleste fert.

Quod de agraria lege quaeris, sane iam videtur refrixisse. Quod me
quodam modo molli brachio de Pompei familiaritate obiurgas, nolim ita
existimes, me mei praesidii causa cum illo coniunctum esse, sed ita res
erat instituta, ut, si inter nos esset aliqua forte dissensio, maximas
in re publica discordias versari esset necesse. Quod a me ita praecautum
atque provisum est, non ut ego de optima illa mea ratione decederem, sed
ut ille esset melior et aliquid de populari levitate deponeret. Quem de
meis rebus, in quas eum multi incitarant, multo scito gloriosius quam de
suis praedicare; sibi enim bene gestae, mihi conservatae rei publicae
dat testimonium. Hoc facere illum mihi quam prosit, nescio; rei publicae
certe prodest. Quid? si etiam Caesarem, cuius nunc venti valde sunt
secundi, reddo meliorem, num tantum obsum rei publicae? Quin etiam, si
mihi nemo invideret, si omnes, ut erat aequum, faverent, tamen non minus
esset probanda medicina, quae sanaret vitiosas partes rei publicae, quam
quae exsecaret.

Footnote 48:

  eos esse in hoc esse _MSS._

“now I am their new patron, I intend to begin the practice: though my
sister, who, as the consul’s wife, has such a lot of room, will not give
me more than standing room.” “Oh, don’t grumble about standing room with
your sister,” I answered. “You can always lie with her.” You will say it
was not the remark for a consular to make. I confess it was not; but I
hate the woman, so unworthy of a consul. “For she’s a shrew and wrangles
with her mate,” and not only with Metellus, but with Fabius too, because
she is annoyed at their interference in this affair.

You ask about the agrarian law. Interest in it seems to have cooled
down. You give me a gentle fillip for my familiarity with Pompey. Please
don’t imagine I have allied myself to him solely to save my skin: the
position of affairs is such that, if we had had any disagreement, there
would of necessity have been great discord in the State. Against that I
have taken precautions and made provision without wavering from my own
excellent policy, while making him more loyal and less the people’s
weathercock. He speaks, I may tell you, far more glowingly about my
achievements than about his own, though many have tried to set him
against me, saying that he did his duty to the country, but I saved it.
What good his statements will do me, I fail to see: but they will
certainly do the country good. Well! If I can make Caesar, who is now
sailing gaily before the breeze, a better patriot too, shall I be doing
so poor a service to the country? And, even if none were to envy me and
all supported me, as they ought, still a remedy which cures the diseased
parts of the State should be preferable to one which amputates them.

Nunc vero, cum equitatus ille, quem ego in clivo Capitolino te signifero
ac principe collocaram, senatum deseruerit, nostri autem principes
digito se caelum putent attingere, si mulli barbati in piscinis sint,
qui ad manum accedant, alia autem neglegant, nonne tibi satis prodesse
videor, si perficio, ut nolint obesse, qui possunt? Nam Catonem nostrum
non tu amas plus quam ego; sed tamen ille optimo animo utens et summa
fide nocet interdum rei publicae; dicit enim tamquam in Platonis
πολιτείᾳ, non tamquam in Romuli faece sententiam. Quid verius quam in
iudicium venire, qui ob rem iudicandam pecuniam acceperit? Censuit hoc
Cato, adsensit senatus; equites curiae bellum, non mihi; nam ego
dissensi. Quid impudentius publicanis renuntiantibus? fuit tamen
retinendi ordinis causa faciunda iactura. Restitit et pervicit Cato.
Itaque nunc consule in carcere incluso, saepe item seditione commota
aspiravit nemo eorum, quorum ego concursu itemque ii consules, qui post
me fuerunt, rem publicam defendere solebant. “Quid ergo? istos,”
inquies, “mercede conductos habebimus?” Quid faciemus, si aliter non
possumus? An libertinis atque etiam servis serviamus? Sed, ut tu ais,
ἅλις σπουδῆς.

But as it is, when the knights, whom I once stationed on the Capitoline
hill with you as their standard-bearer and leader, have deserted the
Senate, and our great men think themselves in the seventh heaven, if
they have bearded mullet in their fish-ponds that will feed from their
hand, and don’t care about anything else, surely you must allow that I
have done my best, if I manage to take the will to do harm from those
who have the power to do it. For our friend Cato is not more to you than
to me: but still with the best of intentions and unimpeachable honesty
at times he does harm to the country: for the opinions he delivers would
be more in place in Plato’s Republic than among the dregs of humanity
collected by Romulus.[49] That a man who accepts a bribe for the verdict
he returns at a trial should be put on trial himself is as fair a
principle as one could wish. Cato voted for it and won the House’s
assent. Result, a war of the knights with the Senate, but not with me. I
was against it. That the tax-collectors should repudiate their bargain
was a most shameless proceeding. But we ought to have put up with the
loss in order to keep their good-will. Cato resisted and carried the
day. Result, though we’ve had a consul in prison, and frequent riots,
not a breath of encouragement from one of those, who in my own
consulship and that of my successors used to rally round us to defend
the country. “Must we then bribe them for their support?” you will ask.
What help is there, if we cannot get it otherwise? Are we to be slaves
of freedmen and slaves? But, as you say, enough of the _grand sérieux_.

  rendering.

Favonius meam tribum tulit honestius quam suam, Luccei perdidit.
Accusavit Nasicam inhoneste ac modeste tamen. Dixit ita, ut Rhodi
videretur molis potius quam Moloni operam dedisse. Mihi, quod
defendissem, leviter suscensuit. Nunc tamen petit iterum rei publicae
causa. Lucceius quid agat, scribam ad te, cum Caesarem videro, qui
aderit biduo. Quod Sicyonii te laedunt, Catoni et eius aemulatori
attribuis Servilio. Quid? ea plaga nonne ad multos bonos viros pertinet?
Sed, si ita placuit, laudemus, deinde in discessionibus soli
relinquamur.

Amalthea mea te exspectat et indiget tui. Tusculanum et Pompeianum valde

otium. Prognostica mea cum oratiunculis prope diem exspecta et tamen,
quid cogites de adventu tuo, scribe ad nos. Nam mihi Pomponia nuntiari
iussit te mense Quintili Romae fore. Id a tuis litteris, quas ad me de
censu tuo miseras, discrepabat.

Paetus, ut antea ad te scripsi, omnes libros, quos frater suus
reliquisset, mihi donavit. Hoc illius munus in tua diligentia positum
est. Si me amas, cura, ut conserventur et ad me perferantur; hoc mihi
nihil potest esse gratius. Et cum Graecos tum vero

Favonius carried my tribe with even more credit than his own, but lost
that of Lucceius. His accusation of Nasica was nothing to be proud of;
however he conducted it very moderately. He spoke so badly that one
would think he devoted more time at Rhodes to grinding in the mills than
at Molo’s lectures. I got into his bad books for undertaking the
defence; however he is standing again now on public grounds. How
Lucceius is getting on I will write and tell you, when I have seen
Caesar, who will be here in a couple of days’ time. The wrong the
Sicyonians have done you, you attribute to Cato and his imitator
Servilius. But does not the blow affect many good citizens? However, if
it so pleases them, let us acquiesce, and be utterly deserted at the
next question put to the vote.

My Amalthea is waiting and longing for you. I am delighted with my
places at Tusculum and Pompeii, except that, champion of creditors as I
am, they have overwhelmed me not so much with Corinthian bronze as with
debts in the common copper coin of the realm. We hope things have
settled down in Gaul. Expect my Prognostics[50] and my bits of speeches
very shortly: but for all that write and tell me your plans about
coming. Pomponia has sent a message that you will be in Rome in July:
but that disagrees with the letter you sent to me about placing your
name on the census list.

Paetus, as I have already mentioned, has given me the books left him by
his brother: but this gift depends on your kind services. As you love
me, see that they are preserved and brought to me. You could do me no
greater favour: and I should like the

Look well after my little namesake. I am ill with him by sympathy. I
have in hand my treatise on the constitution of Pellene, and you should
see the huge heap of Dicaearchus that I have piled at my feet. What a
great man! You could learn a lot more from him than from Procilius. I
believe I have got his works on the constitutions of Corinth and Athens
at Rome: and you may take my word for it that, if you read them, you
will exclaim “The man is a wonder.” If Herodes had any sense in him, he
would spend his time reading him and never write a single letter of the
alphabet. He has attacked me by post, and you, as I see, in person. I
would far rather have joined in the conspiracy than opposed it, if I had
thought I should have to pay for it by listening to him. As regards the
darnel, you must be losing your senses: but about the wine I quite agree
with you.

But, I say, have you noticed the Kalends are coming, and there is no
Antonius? Though the jury is being empanelled,—at least they tell me so,

on any juror who does not attend. If you

First a trifle please for good news. Valerius has been acquitted, with
Hortensius as his advocate. The verdict is generally thought to be a
concession to Aulus’ son; and I expect Iphicrates[54] has been up to
some tricks, as you suggest. I didn’t like the look of his military
boots and puttees. We shall know what it was, when you arrive.

In finding fault with the narrowness of my windows, let me tell you, you
are finding fault with the Education of Cyrus[55]: for, when I made the
same remark to Cyrus, he said that the view of gardens was not so
pleasant, if the windows were broad. For, let _a_ be the point of
vision, and _b, c_ the object, and _d, e_ the rays,—you see what
follows. If our sight resulted from the impact of images,[56] the images
would be horribly squeezed in the narrow space: but, as it is, the
emission of rays goes on merrily. If you have any other faults to find,
you will find me ready with an answer, unless they are such as can be
put to rights without expense.

Footnote 54:

  Obviously a nickname for Pompey, and, in view of the next sentence,
  the name of Iphicrates, who invented a military boot, seems more
  likely than Epicrates, which would mean “our influential friend.”

Footnote 55:

  A play on the title of Xenophon’s book the _Cyropaedeia_ and the name
  of Cicero’s architect.

Footnote 56:

  Democritus and the Epicureans held that sight resulted from the
  incidence of images cast by external things upon the eyes. The view
  supported by Cicero, that it resulted from rays sent out from the
  eyes, was that held by Plato.

Venio nunc ad mensem Ianuarium et ad ὑπόστασιν nostram ac πολιτείαν, in
qua Σωκρατικῶς εἰς ἑκάτερον, sed tamen ad extremum, ut illi solebant,

resistendum est legi agrariae, in quo est quaedam dimicatio, sed plena
laudis, aut quiescendum, quod est non dissimile atque ire in Solonium
aut Antium, aut etiam adiuvandum, quod a me aiunt Caesarem sic
exspectare, ut non dubitet. Nam fuit apud me Cornelius, hunc dico
Balbum, Caesaris familiarem. Is adfirmabat illum omnibus in rebus meo et
Pompei consilio usurum daturumque operam, ut cum Pompeio Crassum
coniungeret. Hic sunt haec, coniunctio mihi summa cum Pompeio, si
placet, etiam cum Caesare, reditus in gratiam cum inimicis, pax cum
multitudine, senectutis otium. Sed me κατακλεὶς mea illa commovet, quae
est in libro tertio:

Now I come to January and my political attitude; and I shall follow the
fashion of the Socratic schools in giving both sides of the question,
ending, however, as they do, with the one which I prefer. It really is a
point that requires much consideration. For either I have got to resist
the agrarian measure strongly, which would mean something of a fight,
though I should gain prestige by it; or I must hold my peace, which is
equivalent to retiring to Solonium or Antium; or else I must assist the
measure, and that is what they say Caesar expects me to do beyond a
doubt. For Cornelius paid me a visit—I mean Balbus, Caesar’s great
friend. He assured me that Caesar will take my own and Pompey’s opinion
on everything, and that he will make an effort to reconcile Pompey and
Crassus. On this side of the sheet may be placed an intimate connection
with Pompey and, if I like, with Caesar too, reconciliation with my
enemies, peace with the populace, and ease in my old age. But my blood
is still stirred by the _finale_ I laid down for myself in the 3rd book
of my poem:[57]

         “Meantime the course you chose in youth’s first spring
         And held to, heart and soul, ’mid civic strife
         Keep still, with growing fame and good report.”

Since Calliope herself dictated those verses to me in a book full of
passages in lordly vein, I ought not to have the least hesitation in
holding “no omen, better [Sidenote: Iliad xii, 243] than to right one’s
country’s wrongs.”

But this point must be reserved for our strolls at the Compitalia. Do
you remember the day before the festival. I will order the bath to be
heated, and Terentia is going to invite Pomponia. We will make

I am much obliged to you for sending me Serapio’s book, though between
you and me I hardly understand a thousandth part of it. I have given
orders for you to be paid ready money for it, to prevent your entering
it among presentation copies. Since I am mentioning money matters,
please settle up with Titinius as best you can. If he won’t stand by his
agreement, the best plan, so far as I can see, will be to return the
goods for which he made a bad bargain, if Pomponia will consent to that
course: if even that won’t work, then give him his money back rather
than have a fuss. I should be very glad if you would finish the business
before you leave, with your usual kindness and carefulness.

So Clodius is going to Tigranes you say! I wish it were on the same
terms as that Scepsian.[58] But I don’t envy him. It will be a much more
convenient time for me to get a free travelling pass, when my brother
Quintus has settled down in peace, as I hope he will, and when I know
the intentions of that priest of Bona Dea.[59] Meantime I shall settle
down to the enjoyment of the Muses with resignation, indeed

For the geography I will endeavour to satisfy you, but I won’t make any
definite promise. It is a big piece of work: still I will do as I am
told, and see to it that this little tour is not entirely unproductive
for you. Let me have any political news you may worm out, especially who
you think are likely to be consuls. However, I am not very anxious. I
have made up my mind to forget politics for the time.

I have had a good look at Terentia’s woodlands, and can only say, that,
if there was a Dodonaean oak there, I should feel as though I possessed
the whole of Epirus. About the first of the month I shall be either in
my place at Formiae, or at Pompeii. If I am not at Formiae, as you love
me, come to Pompeii. I shall be delighted to see you, and it won’t be
far out of your way. With regard to the wall, I have given orders to
Philotimus to let you do anything you like: but I think you ought to
call in Vettius. In these days, when every honest man’s life hangs in

for a summer, but not to the extent of wishing Pomponia and her boy to
live in terror of a tottering ruin.

an offer is made to me, the decision will to some extent rest in my own

This is what I am hoping to hear from you in your letter:—what Arrius

is going away. That is the only bait with which they could catch me. You
see how cheap I am going. But this is a forbidden subject. I mean to

I am not so certain now about fulfilling the promises I made in former
letters to produce some work in this tour: for I have fallen so in love
with idleness, that I can’t tear myself from it. So I either enjoy
myself with my books, of which I have a jolly good lot at Antium, or
else count the waves: the rough weather won’t allow me to catch shads.
At writing my soul rebels utterly. The geographical work I had planned
is a big undertaking. Eratosthenes, whom I had taken as my authority, is
severely criticized by Serapion and Hipparchus; and, if I take
Tyrannio’s views too, there is no telling what the result would be.
Besides the subject is confoundedly hard to explain and monotonous, nor
does it give one as many opportunities for flowers of fancy as I
imagined: besides—and this is the chief point—I find any excuse for
idleness good enough. I am even debating settling down at Antium, and
spending the rest of my life here: and I really wish I had been a
magistrate here

rather than in Rome. You have been wiser in your generation and made a
home for yourself at Buthrotum: but you may take my word for it that
this township of Antium runs your borough very close. To think of there
being a place so near Rome, where there are lots of people who have
never seen Vatinius, where there is not a single soul save myself who
cares whether any of our new commissioners are alive or dead, where no
one intrudes upon me, though every one is fond of me. This, this is the
very place for me to play the politician: for there in Rome, besides
being shut out of politics, I am sick of them. So I will compose a
private memoir, which I will read only to you, in the style of
Theopompus, or even a still bitterer vein. My only policy now is hatred
of the radicals: and that without rancour, indeed with some pleasure in
expressing it.

But to return to business, I have written to the city quaestors about my
brother Quintus’ affairs. See what they have to say, and whether there
is any hope of our getting current coin, or whether we must put up with
Pompey’s pice.[61] Also decide what is to be done with the wall. Is
there anything else I meant to say? Yes. Let me know when you think of
going away.

I will give the geography further consideration. As to the two speeches
you ask for, one I did not want to write down, because I had broken off
in the middle, the other, because I had no desire to praise a man whom I
did not like. But that too I will see about. Something shall appear
anyhow, to convince you that I have not idled all my time away.

I am highly delighted with the news about Publius, please investigate
all the details thoroughly, and bring a full account with you when you
come. Meantime, if you pick up any hints, or draw any inferences, write
to me, especially as to what he is going to do about the embassy. For my
part, before 1 read your letter, I wished the man would go, not, I
assure you, through any desire to postpone his impeachment—for I am
extraordinarily anxious to conduct the case—but because I thought that
he would lose any popularity he had gained by turning plebeian. “Why did
you transfer yourself to the plebs? Was it to pay a visit to Tigranes?
Pray tell me: don’t the kings of Armenia return the visit of a
patrician?” As you see, I had sharpened my wits up to rally him on the
subject of his embassy. But if he rejects it with scorn, and, as you
say, thereby rouses the indignation of the proposers and augurs of the
bill of adoption, it will be a grand sight. To speak the honest truth,
you know, our friend Publius is being treated with very scant courtesy.
In the first place, though he was once the only man in

domi Caesaris quandam unus vir fuerit, nunc ne in viginti quidem esse
potuerit; deinde alia legatio dicta erat, alia data est. Illa opima ad

reservatur; haec ieiuna tabellarii legatio datur ei, cuius tribunatus ad
istorum tempora reservatur. Incende hominem, amabo te, quod potes. Una
spes est salutis istorum inter ipsos dissensio; cuius ego quaedam initia

Caesar’s house, now he has not a footing even among twenty; and in the
second place, one embassy is talked of, and another is given to him.
That fat post for levying money is reserved for Drusus of Pisaurum, I
suppose, or for the gourmand Vatinius, while this barren messenger’s job
is given to him, and his tribunate too has to wait their convenience.
Fire the fellow’s resentment please, as much as you can. My one hope of
safety lies in their mutual disagreement: and from Curio I gather that
there is a hint of such a thing. Arrius is beginning to rage at being
robbed of his consulship: Megabocchus and the rest of that bloodthirsty
band of youths are at daggers drawn with them. And God grant there may
come a dispute about this augurship on the top. I hope I shall have
occasion to send you some of my very best letters and plenty of them on
these topics.

But I am anxious to know the meaning of that dark hint of yours, that
even some of the board of five commissioners are speaking their minds.
What on earth can it be? If there really is anything in it, things are
in a better way than I thought. Please don’t imagine that I ask the
question with a view to action, because my soul is yearning to take part
in politics. I have long been sick of holding the helm, even when I was
allowed to do so: and now, when I have been marooned and the helm torn
from my grasp without waiting for me to surrender it, my only desire is
to watch their shipwreck from the dry land. I could wish, as your friend
Sophocles says,

When I was looking forward eagerly to a letter of yours towards evening,
as usual, lo and behold a message that some slaves had come from Rome. I
called them, and inquired if they had any letters. “No,” they said.
“What’s that,” said I, “nothing from Pomponius?” Frightened to death by
my voice and look they confessed they had been given one, but it had
been lost on the way. As you may suppose, I was wild with annoyance. For
every letter you have sent me these last few days has contained
something of importance or entertainment. So, if there was anything
worth saying in the letter of the 15th of April, write at once and let
me know it: if there was nothing but nonsense, you owe me a repetition
of it.

as to reach Antium on the 3rd. There are games at Antium from the 4th to
the 6th of May, and Tullia wants to see them. Then I am thinking of
going to Tusculum, and from there to Arpinum, reaching Rome on the 1st
of June. Be sure you pay me a visit either at Formiae or at Antium, or
at my place at Tusculum. Reproduce your former letter for me, and add

me is not kept, I am in the seventh heaven with delight at thinking how
that Jerusalemite plebeian-monger will learn what a pretty return he has
made for all my choicest panegyrics: and you may expect recantation of
eclipsing brilliancy; for, so far as I can see, if that good-for-nothing
is in favour with our sovereigns, he will have to give up crowing over
the “ex-consul with a cynic’s tongue” and those “Tritons of the
fish-ponds” together: for there will be nothing to envy me for, when I
have been robbed of my power and my influence in the Senate. If on the
other hand he quarrels with them, then any attack on me would be absurd.
However let him attack, if he likes.

Upon my word the wheel of State has turned round gaily and with less
noise than I had expected: more quickly to be sure than it might have
done. That is Cato’s fault, but it is still more through the villainy of
those who have disregarded auspices and the Aelian law, the Iunian and
Licinian law and the Caecilian and Didian law, who have thrown out of
the window all the physic for the State, who have given kingdoms to
tetrarchs as though they were farms and immense sums of money to one or
two people. I can see already which way jealousy is tending and where it
will come home to roost. Count me too big a dunce to have learned
anything by experience or from Theophrastus, if you do not see very
shortly men mourning for the days of my government. For if the power of
the Senate was unpopular, you can imagine what things will be like now,
when the power has been transferred not to the people, but to three
unbridled men. So let them make anyone they like consuls and tribunes,

political news, and not only what was happening, but what was going to
happen too. Now I can’t get to know anything, unless I pick up chance
news from a passing traveller. So, although I am expecting you here very
soon, give this man of mine, who is under orders to return at once, a
bulky missive, full of news of all that has happened and what you think
about it: and don’t forget to say what day you are leaving Rome. I

is at deadly enmity with Caesar,” he replies, “and wants to annul all
those laws of his.” “And what is Caesar doing?” I inquired. “He is
denying that he ever proposed Clodius’ adoption.” Then he emptied the
vials of his own wrath and that of Memmius and Metellus Nepos. I
embraced the youth and said good-bye, being in a hurry to get to your
letters. What a lot of nonsense is talked about “viva vox”? Why, I
learned a dozen times as much about affairs from your letter as from his
talk—the daily chit-chat, the designs of Publius, Juno’s war-cries, how
Athenio[71] is raising the standard, his letter

made me wild with inquisitiveness about that “fast” dinner. My curiosity
is insatiable: but I have no grievance at your omitting to write an
account of the dinner. I would much rather hear it by word of mouth.

As for your exhortations to write something, my material certainly is

You are right in admiring Dicaearchus. He is a splendid fellow and a far
better patriot than any of these great men of ours to whom his name
would certainly not apply.[73] I write this on the day of the Cerealia
at four o’clock, as soon as I read yours: but I am thinking of giving it

country cannot endure that despotism you endure. If you come to this

Magnus—a name which is now growing as obsolete as Crassus’ surname
Dives—held in the deepest abhorrence. You may not believe me, but I have
not met anyone here who takes the matter as coolly as myself. So follow

You have aroused the liveliest curiosity in me as to your talk with
Bibulus and your conversation with Juno, and about that “fast” dinner
too. So remember my ears are thirsting for news, and come quickly.
However, the thing I am most afraid of at the present moment is that our
friend the Pasha may run amuck as soon as he realizes that every one is
railing at him and laying it on to him, and that these new measures are
quite easy to upset. For myself, however, I have grown so slack that I
should prefer to waste my life in my present ease under a despotism than
to take part in the struggle however bright the prospect of success. As
for the writing, for which you so incessantly clamour, it is impossible.

I fully realize that, as you say, your letter only reflects the general
uncertainty of public affairs: but still that very variety of talk and
opinion has its charm: for I feel as though I was at Rome, when I read
your letter, and was hearing first one thing and then another, as one
does on questions of importance. But what I can’t make out is how Caesar
can possibly find any solution of the land question which will not meet
with opposition. As to Bibulus’ firmness in impeding the comitia, it
amounts to nothing but an expression of his opinion and does not improve

publicae? Nimirum in Publio spes est. Fiat, fiat tribunus pl., si nihil
aliud, ut eo citius tu ex Epiro revertare; nam, ut illo tu careas, non

quidem non dubium est, quin, si quid erit eius modi, sis advolaturus.

the position of affairs at all. Upon my word our only hope rests in
Publius. Let him by all means become tribune; if for no other reason, to
make you return all the sooner from Epirus. For I don’t see how you can
possibly keep away from him, especially if he should choose to quarrel
with me. But of course I have no doubt that you would fly to my side, if
anything of the kind were to happen. But, even if this does not happen,
I am looking forward to a sight worth seeing, whether he runs amuck or
saves the state, if I can watch it with you sitting by my side.

Just as I was writing these words, in comes Sebosus: and I had hardly
fetched a sigh, when there was Arrius saying “Good day.” This is going
out of town! Is it escaping from society to run into people like this? I
shall certainly be off to “My native hills, the cradle of my youth.” To
put it shortly, if I can’t be alone, I would rather be with countryfolk
than with these ultra-city men. However, as you send no definite date, I
will wait for you at Formiae till the 5th of May.

Terentia is much gratified by the attention and care you have bestowed
on her dispute with Mulvius. She has not the least idea that you are
supporting the common cause of all the owners of public land. However
you do pay something to the tax-collectors; while she refuses to pay a
penny. Accordingly she and my boy, a most conservative lad, send their
respects.

As I was taking a nap after dinner on the last of April, your letter
about the Campanian land arrived. Well, at first it startled me so that
it banished all desire to sleep, though it was thought rather than
uneasiness that kept me awake. The result of my cogitations was
something of this sort. First, when you said in your last letter you had
heard from a great friend of Caesar’s that some proposal was going to be
made to which no one could object, I had feared some sweeping measure;
but this I don’t consider anything of the kind. Secondly—and that is
some consolation to me—all hope of agrarian distribution seems to have
been diverted to the Campanian land. Supposing that the allotments are
about 6 acres apiece, that land will not hold more than 5,000 people; so
they have to offend all the rest of the masses. Besides, if anything is
calculated to arouse a fiercer pitch of indignation in the minds of the
conservatives, who are obviously getting roused already, this is the
very thing that will; all the more so because there won’t be any home
tax left except the 5 per cent.,[76] now that the customs duties have
been abolished, if the Campanian land is distributed: and that, I fancy,
it would take only one petty harangue assisted by the cheers of our
lacqueys to abolish. What on earth our friend Gnaeus is thinking of in
letting himself be carried so far, I cannot tell:

               He blows no more on slender pipe of reed,
               But fierce unmodulated trumpet-blasts.

For up to now he has chopped logic about the matter, saying that he
approved of Caesar’s laws, but it was for Caesar to see to their
passing: that the agrarian law was sound enough to his mind, but whether
it could be vetoed by a tribune or not did not matter to him: he thought
it was high time the question was settled with the king of Alexandria:
whether Bibulus had been watching for omens or not at that particular
moment was no business of his: as for the tax-gatherers, they were a
class that he wished to oblige: what was going to happen, if Bibulus
came down to the forum on that occasion, he could not have prophesied.
But now what has the Pasha got to say for himself? That he imposed a tax
on Antilibanus and took it off the Campanian land? Well, I don’t see how
he will make it good. “I will keep you in check with Caesar’s army,” he
says. No, not me at least; that army will not restrain me so much as the
ungrateful minds of the so-called constitutionalists, who have not
repaid my services even by thanks, much less by more substantial
rewards. But, if I were really to rouse myself to energy against that
party, I would certainly find some means of resisting them. As it is,
since there is such an endless controversy between your intimate
Dicaearchus and my friend Theophrastus, Dicaearchus giving the
preference to a practical life, Theophrastus to a contemplative, I have
set my mind on making it clear that I have humoured them both. I take it
I have fully satisfied Dicaearchus: now I am turning my eye to the other
school, which not only gives me permission to take my ease now, but
blames me for ever having done anything else. So, my dear Titus, let me
throw myself heart and soul into those excellent studies,

As for your complaints about my brother Quintus’ letter, to me, too, it
seemed “a lion before, behind”—heaven knows what. For the groans in the
first lines about his long absence would touch anybody’s heart: then
afterwards he calms down sufficiently to ask me to touch up and edit his
journal. Please pay some attention to the point you mention about the
dues on goods transferred from port to port. He says he referred it to
the Senate by the advice of his assessors. Evidently he had not read my
letter, in which I told him after careful consideration and research
that no tax was legally due. If any Greeks have come from Asia to Rome
about it, please see them, and, it you think fit, tell them my opinion.
If I can recant, I will do as the tax collectors wish, rather than see
the good cause worsted in the House: but, if not, I candidly confess I
prefer the interests of the whole of Asia and the merchants, for I feel
it is really a matter of great importance to them. I think, however, it
is a case of necessity for us. But you will see to it. Are the
quaestors, then, still debating about the currency? If there is no
escape from it in spite of all our efforts, I shouldn’t turn up my nose
at the Asiatic coins as the last resource. I shall see you at Arpinum,
and give you a country welcome, since you have despised this at the
seaside.

I agree entirely with what you say in your letter. The Pasha is running
amuck. We may anticipate anything: he is quite clearly setting up a
tyranny. What else is the meaning of this sudden marriage-contract,[79]
of the proposals about the Campanian land, of this reckless expenditure
of money? If that were the end of it, it would be disastrous enough: but
the nature of the case makes it impossible that this should be the end.
These things in themselves cannot possibly give them any pleasure: and
they would never have taken this step except as the first to other
pernicious acts. But, as you say, we will discuss these questions
rationally at Arpinum about the 10th of May, and not prove all the
labour and the midnight oil we have spent on our studies wasted by
weeping over them. Heaven help us! I derive consolation not so much from
hope, as I did formerly, as from a spirit of indifference, which I call
to my service especially in civic and political matters. Nay more, the
little strain of vanity and thirst for fame that there is in me—it is a
good thing to recognize one’s own faults—even experiences a pleasurable
sensation. For the thought that the Pasha’s services to the country
might in the dim future be reckoned higher than mine, used to prick me
to the heart: but now I rest quite easy on that score. He has fallen so
low that the fallen Curius in comparison seems to stand erect. But of
this when we meet. It seems now as though you will be at Rome when I
arrive: for which I shall not be at all sorry, if it is

I have received several letters of yours, and from them I see with what
tense anxiety you are looking forward to news. We are hemmed in on every
side; yet we do not rebel at servitude, fearing death and exile as
though they were greater evils, whereas they are really far lesser
evils. Yes, that is the position, and though every one groans about it,
not a voice is raised to relieve it. The object, I presume, of those who
hold the reins is to leave nothing for anyone else to give away. One man
only opens his mouth and opposes them publicly, and that is young Curio.
The loyal party cheers him loudly, greets him in the forum with the
highest respect, and shows its good-will to him in many other ways,
while Fufius is pursued with shouts and jeers and hisses. But this
raises not one’s hope so much as one’s disgust at seeing the people’s
will so free and their courage so enslaved. And, not to enter into
details with you, affairs have come to such a pass that there is no hope
of ever again having free magistrates, let alone a free people. But in
the midst of this tyranny speech is freer than ever, at any rate in
clubs and over our

Sed de re publica non libet plura scribere. Displiceo mihi nec sine

blankest despair everywhere. The Campanian law goes so far as to impose
upon candidates a formula of execration upon themselves if they propose
any different occupation of the land to that laid down by the Julian
laws, to be used by them in their speech as candidates. The others
showed no compunction in taking the oath: but Laterensis is thought a
hero because he threw up his candidature for the tribunate rather than
take it.

I have no heart to write more about politics. I am disgusted with myself
and it is agony to me to write. I stand my ground without losing
self-respect considering the universal servility, but with less courage
than I could wish considering my past record. Caesar most liberally
invites me to take a place on his personal staff: and I even have an
offer of a free travelling pass nominally to fulfil a vow.[81] But it is
hardly safe to trust to that Beauty’s delicacy to that extent. Besides
it would mean that I should not be here for my brother’s return. The
other post is much safer, and does not prevent me from being here when I
wish. The free pass I have, but I don’t think I shall use it. No one
knows of it however. I don’t want to run away; I long to fight. I have
plenty of ardent admirers. But I won’t take my oath on anything, and
please don’t mention what I’ve said.

I am much distressed about the manumission of Statius and some other
things, but I’ve become thick-skinned by now. I wish you were here, I

I have many causes for anxiety, both from the troubled state of the

me. But nothing annoys me more than Statius’ manumission:

But what I am to do, I don’t know; and the matter is more talk than
anything. I can never be angry with those I really love: I can only feel
sorrow, and very deep sorrow too. My other cares are for important
matters. Clodius’ threats and the struggle I have to face do not affect
me much: for I think I can face the music with dignity or avoid the
danger without unpleasantness. Perhaps you will say: “Hang dignity. It’s
prehistoric.[82] For mercy’s sake look after your safety,” Alas! Why
aren’t you here? You would notice everything: while I perhaps am blinded
by my passion for high ideals. Nothing was ever so scandalous, so
disgraceful, and so objectionable to every rank and class of men young
or old as this present state of affairs, far more so than I expected,
nay upon my soul it is more so than I could wish. The popular party have

To my infinite sorrow, my pet, Pompey, has shattered his own reputation.
They have no hold on anyone by affection: and I am afraid they may find
it necessary to try the effect of fear. I do not quarrel with them on
account of my friendship for him, though I refrain from showing approval
not to stultify all my previous actions. I keep to the high-road. The
popular feeling can be seen best in the theatre and at public
exhibitions. For at the gladiatorial show both the leader[84] and his
associates were overwhelmed with hisses: at the games in honour of
Apollo the actor Diphilus made an impertinent attack on Pompey, “By our
misfortunes thou art Great,” which was encored again and again. “A time
will come when thou wilt rue that might” he declaimed amid the cheers of
the whole audience, and so on with the rest. For indeed the verses do
look as though they had been written for the occasion by an enemy of
Pompey: “If neither law nor custom can constrain,” etc. was received
with a tremendous uproar and outcry. At Caesar’s entry the applause
dwindled away; but young Curio who followed was applauded as Pompey used
to be when the constitution was still sound. Caesar was much annoyed:
and it is said a letter flew post haste to Pompey at Capua.

They are annoyed with the knights who stood up and clapped Curio, and
their hand is against every man’s. They are threatening the Roscian law
and even the corn law. Things are in a most disturbed condition. I used
to think it would be best silently to ignore their doings, but I am
afraid that will be impossible. The public cannot put up with things,
and yet it looks as though they would have to put up with them. The
whole people speak now with one voice, but the unanimity has no
foundation but common hate.

Anyhow our friend Publius is threatening me and making hostile advances:
there is trouble ahead, and you must fly to the rescue. I think I have
at my back the same firm bodyguard of all the sound men and even the
moderately sound, as I had in my consulship. The affection Pompey shows
me is more than ordinary. He declares Clodius will not say a word
against me: but there he is deceiving himself not me. I have been asked
to fill Cosconius’ place[85] now he is dead. That would be stepping into
a dead man’s shoes, with a vengeance! I should disgrace myself utterly
in the world’s eyes: and nothing could be more opposed to the state of
safety you keep talking of. For that board is unpopular with the loyal
party, and so I should keep my unpopularity with the disloyal and take
up another’s burden too. Caesar wants me to go as his lieutenant. That
would be a more honourable way of getting out of danger. But I don’t
want to shirk it, for the very good reason that I prefer fighting.
However nothing is settled, I repeat, I wish you were here. However,

Political matters I shall only touch on briefly: for I am beginning to
be afraid that the very paper may betray me. So in future, if I have to
write in fuller detail to you, I shall hide my meaning under covert
language. Now the State is dying of a new disease. The measures that
have been passed cause universal discontent and grumbling and
indignation: there is no disagreement on the point and people are now
venting their opinion and their disapproval openly and loudly, yet no
remedy is applied. Resistance seems impossible without bloodshed: nor
can we see any other end to concession except destruction. Bibulus is
exalted to the skies amid universal admiration and popularity. His
edicts and speeches are copied out and read. He has attained the height
of glory in quite a novel way. Nothing is so popular now as hatred of
the popular party. I have my fears about the issue of all this. But I
will write more clearly, if I get any definite views. Do you, if your
affection for me is as real as I know it to be, hold yourself ready to
run to my call, when it comes. But I am doing my best, and will continue
to do it, to prevent any necessity. I said I would call you Furius in my
letters, but there is no need to alter your name. I will call myself
Laelius and you Atticus, and I won’t use my own handwriting or seal, at
any rate if the letters are such that I should not like them to fall

To enter into details about politics would be superfluous. The whole

than when you left. Then it looked as though we were oppressed with a
tyranny which was popular with the lower classes, and, though annoying
to the upper, still comparatively harmless: but now it has become
suddenly so universally detested that I tremble for the issue. For we
have had an experience of the wrath and recklessness of the Triumvirs,
and in their indignation with Cato, they have ruined the state. The
poisons they used seemed to be so slow that I thought we could die
painlessly. But now I am afraid they have been roused to energy by the

amor, ut exhauriri nulla posset

scarcely catch the sound of its motion, and scarcely see the track of
its path: and that is what would have happened, if people could only
have waited for the storm to pass. But for a while they stifled their
sighs; then they began to groan aloud; and finally all set about airing
their grievances at the top of their voices. And so our friend, being
unused to unpopularity, and having always lived in an atmosphere of
flattery and glory, disfigured in person and broken in spirit, does not
know what to do with himself: he sees that to advance is dangerous, to
retreat a confession of weakness: the respectable parties are his
enemies, the very riff-raff not his friends.

Yet see how soft-hearted I am. I could not restrain my tears, when I saw
him on the 25th of July delivering a speech on the subject of the edicts
of Bibulus. He used to carry himself with such a lofty bearing, enjoying
unbounded popularity and universal respect: and now, how humble he was,
how cast down, and what discontent he aroused in himself as well as in
his hearers! What a sight! Crassus may have enjoyed it, but no one else.
For seeing that he had fallen from the stars, one could not but
attribute his swift descent to accident rather than to voluntary motion.
And, just as Apelles or Protogenes, if they had seen their Venus or
Ialysus smeared with mud, would, I imagine, have been cut to the heart,
so I myself could not but feel poignant grief at seeing the idol on
whose adornment I had lavished all the colours of my art suddenly
disfigured. For though no one looked on it as my duty to retain my
friendship with him after the Clodian affair, my affection for him was
such that no slight could extinguish

iniuria. Itaque Archilochia in illum edicta Bibuli populo ita sunt
iucunda, ut eum locum, ubi proponuntur, prae multitudine eorum, qui
legunt, transire nequeamus, ipsi ita acerba, ut tabescat dolore, mihi
mehercule molesta, quod et eum, quem semper dilexi, nimis excruciant, et
timeo, tam vehemens vir tamque acer in ferro et tam insuetus contumeliae
ne omni animi impetu dolori et iracundiae pareat.

Bibuli qui sit exitus futurus, nescio. Ut nunc res se habet, admirabili
gloria est. Qui cum comitia in mensem Octobrem distulisset, quod solet
ea res populi voluntatem offendere, putarat Caesar oratione sua posse
impelli contionem, ut iret ad Bibulum; multa cum seditiosissime diceret,
vocem exprimere non potuit. Quid quaeris? sentiunt se nullam ullius
partis voluntatem tenere. Eo magis vis nobis est timenda.

Clodius inimicus est nobis. Pompeius confirmat eum nihil esse facturum
contra me. Mihi periculosum est credere, ad resistendum me paro. Studia
spero me summa habiturum omnium ordinum. Te cum ego desidero, tum vero
res ad tempus illud vocat. Plurimum consilii, animi, praesidii denique
mihi, si te ad tempus videro, accesserit. Varro mihi satis facit.
Pompeius loquitur divinitus. Spero nos aut certe cum summa gloria aut
etiam sine molestia discessuros. Tu quid agas, quem ad modum te
oblectes, quid cum Sicyoniis egeris, ut sciam, cura.

it. The result, is that now Bibulus’ scathing[90] edicts against him are
so popular, that one can’t pass the place where they are posted up for
the crowd of people reading them. Pompey finds them so distressing that
he is wasting away with grief; and I myself am much annoyed with them,
partly because they cause so much pain to a man whom I have always
loved, and partly for fear that being so impulsive and ready to draw the
sword, as well as so unused to abuse, he may give full reins to his
indignation and wrath.

I don’t know what will be the end of Bibulus. As things stand at present
his reputation is extraordinarily high. When he put off the elections
till October, which generally annoys the populace, Caesar thought he
could induce the people by a speech to attack Bibulus: but in spite of
all his seditious talk, he could not ring a word out of anybody. In
short they feel that they have lost the good-will of all parties: and so
violent action on their part is all the more to be feared.

Clodius is hostile to me. Pompey assures me he will do nothing against
me: but I am afraid to trust him and am getting ready for resistance. I
hope I shall have very strong support from all classes. For your
presence I have a longing myself and circumstances call for it to meet
the crisis. If I see you in time, I shall feel it a great accession to
my policy, my courage and my safety. Varro is very obliging; and Pompey
talks like an angel. I hope that in the end I shall either be certain of
a glorious victory, or even escape unmolested. Let me know what you are
doing, how you are enjoying yourself, and what has happened as regards
the Sicyonians.

How I wish you were in town! You would certainly have stayed, if we had
thought this was going to happen. For then we could have easily kept
that little Beauty in order or at any rate should have known what he was
going to do. As it is he flits about in a frenzy and doesn’t know what
he is doing; he threatens lots of people, but will probably do whatever
turns up. When he sees the general abhorrence of the present state of
affairs he seems to meditate an attack on the authors of it; but when he
remembers the armed force behind them, he turns his wrath against the
loyalists. As for me, he threatens me now with brute force, and now with
a prosecution. Pompey spoke to him about it, and according to his own
account—for he is the only witness I have—he remonstrated strongly with
him, saying that he would become a byword for treachery and
underhandedness, if my life were threatened by one whose weapons he
himself had forged by acquiescing in his transference to the plebs: that
both he and Appius had pledged their word for me: and that, unless
Clodius respected their promise, he would be so annoyed that he would
make it plain to the world that he prized my friendship beyond
everything. He declared that after he had said this and much more to the
same effect, Clodius at first persisted in arguing the point at length,
but finally gave way and

facturum. Sed postea tamen ille non destitit de nobis asperrime loqui.
Quodsi non faceret, tamen ei nihil crederemus atque omnia, sicut
facimus, pararemus.

Nunc ita nos gerimus, ut in dies singulos et studia in nos hominum et
opes nostrae augeantur; rem publicam nulla ex parte attingimus, in
causis atque in illa opera nostra forensi summa industria versamur; quod
egregie non modo iis, qui utuntur opera, sed etiam in vulgus gratum esse
sentimus. Domus celebratur, occurritur, renovatur memoria consulatus,
studia significantur; in eam spem adducimur, ut nobis ea contentio; quae

possunt, quae te urgente erunt firmiora, multa ab ipso Publio elici,
multa cognosci, quae tibi occulta esse non poterunt, multa etiam—sed
absurdum est singula explicare, cum ego requiram te ad omnia. Unum illud
tibi persuadeas velim, omnia mihi fore explicata, si te videro; sed
totum est in eo, si ante, quam ille ineat magistratum. Puto Pompeium

promised he would not do anything to offend him. Since then, however, he
has not ceased to speak very unpleasantly about me: but, even if he did
not, I should not believe him and should continue the preparations which
I am making.

At the present time I am managing things so that my popularity and the
strength of my position increases daily. Politics I am not touching at
all, but am busily engaged in the law courts and in my other forensic
work: and thereby I find I win extraordinary favour not only with those
who enjoy my services, but with the people in general too. My house is
thronged with folk; processions meet me; the days of my consulship are
recalled; friendships are not disguised: and my hopes are so raised that
I often think there is no reason for me to shrink from the struggle
which threatens.

What I want now is your advice and your affection and loyalty: so fly to
me. It will simplify everything, if I have you with me. Varro can render
me many services, but they would be far surer if you were here to
support them: a great deal of information can be extracted from Publius
himself, and a great deal found out, which could not possibly be kept
from your ears: besides a great deal more—but it is absurd to specify
details, when I want you for everything. The one point I want you to
grasp is that the mere sight of you would simplify everything for me;
but it all depends on your coming before he enters on his office. I
think that, though Crassus is egging on Pompey, if you were here and
could find out from the enemy through Juno how far the great men are to
be trusted, I should either escape molestation altogether or at any rate
I should no longer be

I don’t think you ever before read a letter of mine which I had not
written myself. That will show you how I am plagued to death by
business. As I haven’t a moment to spare, and must take some exercise to
refresh my poor voice, I am dictating this as I walk.

Well, the first thing I have to tell you, is that our friend the Pasha
is heartily sick of his position and wants to be restored to the place
from which he fell. He confides his sorrows to me, and at times openly
looks for a remedy; but for the life of me I cannot find any. Secondly,
the whole of that party, both the principals and their followers, are
losing their strength, though no one opposes them; and there

never was a greater unanimity of sentiment or of the popular expression
of it than there is now.

As for me—for I am sure you want to hear about myself—I take no part in
public deliberations and devote myself entirely to my law-court
practice, which arouses, as you can easily conceive, many a memory of my
past achievements and much regret for them. But our dear Juno’s brother
is venting most alarming threats and, though he denies them to the
Pasha, he openly parades them to others. So, if your affection is as
real as I know it is, wake up, if you are sleeping, start moving, if you
are standing still, run, if you are moving, and fly, if you are running.
I set greater store than you can possibly believe by your advice and
your wisdom, and, what is still more, by your love and your loyalty. The
importance of the theme would perhaps demand a long disquisition; but
our hearts are so united that a word is enough. It is of the highest
importance to me that you should be in Rome after the elections, if you
can’t get here before them. Take care of yourself.

spero, non tam exitu molesta quam aditu. Vettius ille, ille noster
index, Caesari, ut perspicimus, pollicitus est sese curaturum, ut in
aliquam suspicionem facinoris Curio filius adduceretur. Itaque
insinuavit in familiaritatem adulescentis et cum eo, ut res indicat,
saepe congressus rem in eum locum deduxit, ut diceret sibi certum esse
cum suis servis in Pompeium impetum facere eumque occidere. Hoc Curio ad
patrem detulit, ille ad Pompeium. Res delata ad senatum est. Introductus
Vettius primo negabat se umquam cum Curione constitisse, neque id sane
diu; nam statim fidem publicam postulavit. Reclamatum est. Tum exposuit
manum fuisse iuventutis duce Curione, in qua Paulus initio fuisset et Q.
Caepio hic Brutus et Lentulus, flaminis filius, conscio patre; postea C.
Septimium, scribam Bibuli, pugionem sibi a Bibulo attulisse. Quod totum
irrisum est, Vettio pugionem defuisse, nisi ei consul dedisset, eoque
magis id eiectum est, quod a. d. III Idus Mai. Bibulus Pompeium fecerat
certiorem, ut caveret insidias; in quo ei Pompeius gratias egerat.

Introductus Curio filius dixit ad ea, quae Vettius dixerat, maximeque in
eo tum quidem Vettius est reprehensus, quod dixerat id fuisse
adulescentium consilium, ut in foro gladiatoribus Gabini Pompeium
adorirentur; in eo principem Paulum fuisse, quem constabat eo tempore in
Macedonia fuisse. Fit senatus

not be so troublesome at the end as at the beginning. That fellow
Vettius, my famous informer, promised Caesar, so far as we can see, that
he would get some criminal suspicion thrown on young Curio. So he wormed
his way into intimacy with the young man and after meeting him often, as
events prove, he went so far as to declare that he was determined to
make an attack on Pompey with the assistance of his slaves, and to slay
him. Curio told his father of this, and he told Pompey. The affair was
reported to the Senate. Vettius was summoned before them and at first
denied that he had ever had an appointment with Curio. However he did
not stick to that tale long; but at once claimed the privilege of king’s
evidence. Amid cries of “no,” he began to explain that there had been a
confederacy of the younger men under the leadership of Curio, to which
Paulus at first belonged and Q. Caepio, Brutus I mean, and Lentulus, the
flamen’s son, with his father’s consent; and then that C. Septimius,
Bibulus’ secretary, had brought him a dagger from Bibulus. The idea of
Vettius not having a dagger, unless the consul gave him one, and the
rest of it, was too much for anybody’s gravity: and the charge was
scouted the more because Bibulus had warned Pompey on the 13th of May to
be on his guard against plots; and Pompey had thanked him for the
advice.

Young Curio was brought in and repelled Vettius’ assertions: and the
point for which Vettius was especially jumped on was saying that the
young men’s intention was to attack Pompey in the forum at the
gladiatorial show which Gabinius gave, and that Paulus was to be the
leader, when it was well known that he was in Macedonia at the time. The
House decreed

consultum, ut Vettius, quod confessus esset se cum telo fuisse, in
vincula coniceretur; qui emisisset, eum contra rem publicam esse
facturum. Res erat in ea opinione, ut putarent id esse actum, ut Vettius
in foro cum pugione et item servi eius comprehenderentur cum telis,
deinde ille se diceret indicaturum. Idque ita factum esset, nisi
Curiones rem ante ad Pompeium detulissent. Tum senatus consultum in
contione recitatum est. Postero autem die Caesar, is qui olim, praetor
cum esset, Q. Catulum ex inferiore loco iusserat dicere, Vettium in
rostra produxit eumque in eo loco constituit, quo Bibulo consuli
adspirare non liceret. Hic ille omnia, quae voluit de re publica, dixit,
et qui illuc factus institutusque venisset, primum Caepionem de oratione
sua sustulit, quem in senatu acerrime nominarat, ut appareret noctem et
nocturnam deprecationem intercessisse. Deinde, quos in senatu ne
tenuissima quidem suspicione attigerat, eos nominavit, L. Lucullum, a
quo solitum esse ad se mitti C. Fannium, illum qui in P. Clodium
subscripserat, L. Domitium, cuius domum constitutam fuisse, unde eruptio
fieret. Me non nominavit, sed dixit consularem disertum vicinum consulis
sibi dixisse Ahalam Servilium aliquem aut Brutum opus esse reperiri.
Addidit ad extremum, cum iam dimissa contione revocatus a Vatinio
fuisset, se audisse a Curione his de rebus conscium esse Pisonem,
generum meum, et M. Laterensem.

Nunc reus erat apud Crassum Divitem Vettius de vi et, cum esset
damnatus, erat indicium postulaturus.

that Vettius should be committed on his own confession of having carried
a weapon; and that it should be high treason to release him. The view
most generally held is that it was a put up job: Vettius was to be
discovered in the forum with a dagger and his slaves round him with
weapons, and then he was to turn king’s evidence: and it would have come
off, if the Curios had not reported the matter to Pompey. Then the
senatorial decree was read aloud to an assembly. On the next day,
however, Caesar, the man who as praetor some years ago had bidden Q.
Catulus speak from the floor, brought Vettius out on the rostra, and set
him in a place which was beyond Bibulus’ aspiration, though a consul.
Here he said anything he liked about public affairs; and, as he had come
ready primed and tutored, he omitted all mention of Caepio, though he
had named him most emphatically in the House: so it was obvious that a
night and a nocturnal appeal had intervened. Then he mentioned people on
whom he had not cast the slightest suspicion in the House,—L. Lucullus,
who, he said, generally used to send to him C. Fannius, the man who once
supported a prosecution of P. Clodius, and L. Domitius, whose house was
to be the basis of operations. My name he did not mention, but he said
that an eloquent ex-consul, a neighbour of the consul, had remarked to
him that we stood in need of a Servilius Ahala or a Brutus. He added at
the end, when he had been called back by Vatinius after the assembly was
dismissed, that he had heard from Curio that Piso, my son-in-law, was in
the plot, and M. Laterensis too.

Now Vettius is on trial for violence before Crassus Dives, and, when he
is condemned, he will claim to turn

king’s evidence. If he is successful there may very well be some
prosecutions. Of that—though to be sure I never despise anything—I’m not
much afraid. Everybody is showing me the greatest kindness; but I am
sick of life; the whole world is so thoroughly out of joint. Just lately
we were afraid of a massacre, but it was averted by a speech of that
gallant old man Q. Considius: and now the disaster of which we had been
in daily fear has suddenly happened. In fact, nothing could be more
deplorable than my situation, nothing more enviable than that of
Catulus, considering his glorious life and his timely end. However, I

When I write to you praising any of your friends, I wish you would let
them know I have done so. For example, I mentioned in a letter lately
Varro’s kindness to me, and you answered that you were delighted to hear
it. But I had much rather you had written to him saying he was doing all
I wished—not

satis facere, non quo faceret, sed ut faceret; mirabiliter enim moratus
est, sicut nosti, ἑλικτὰ καὶ οὐδέν—Sed nos tenemus praeceptum illud τὰς
τῶν κρατούντων—. At hercule alter tuus familiaris, Hortalus, quam plena
manu, quam ingenue, quam ornate nostras laudes in astra sustulit, cum de
Flacci praetura et de illo tempore Allobrogum diceret! Sic habeto, nec
amantius nec honorificentius nec copiosius potuisse dici. Ei te hoc
scribere a me tibi esse missum sane volo. Sed quid tu scribas? quem iam
ego venire atque adesse arbitror; ita enim egi tecum superioribus
litteris. Valde te exspecto, valde desidero neque ego magis, quam ipsa
res et tempus poscit.

His de negotiis quid scribam ad te nisi idem quod saepe? re publica
nihil desperatius, iis, quorum opera, nihil maiore odio. Nos, ut opinio
et spes et coniectura nostra fert, firmissima benevolentia hominum
muniti sumus. Quare advola; aut expedies nos omni molestia aut eris
particeps. Ideo sum brevior, quod, ut spero, coram brevi tempore
conferre, quae volumus, licebit. Cura, ut valeas.

that he was, but to make him do it. For, as you know, he is an odd
creature, “all tortuous thoughts and no—”.[93] But I hold to the maxim,
“A great man’s follies.”[94] However, your other friend, Hortalus, most
certainly lauded me to the skies in the most liberal, open-hearted and
elaborate manner, when he was delivering a speech on Flaccus’
praetorship and that incident of the Allobroges. You may take my word
for it that he could not have expressed himself in more affectionate and
laudatory terms, nor more fully. I should much like you to write and
tell him that I sent you word of it. But I hope you won’t have to write,
and are now on your way and quite close after the appeals in my former
letter. I am eagerly looking out for you, and in sore need of you: and
circumstances and the times call for you as much as I do.

On these affairs I have nothing new to say: the country is in the most
desperate position possible, and nothing could exceed the unpopularity
of those who are responsible for it. I myself, as I think, hope and
imagine, am safeguarded by the staunchest support. So hasten your
coming: you will either relieve all my cares or share them with me. If I
am rather brief, it is because I hope that I may soon be able to discuss
anything I wish with you face to face. Take care of yourself.

I had been thinking that it would be of the greatest service to me to
have you with me, but when I read the bill,[95] I saw at once that the
most desirable thing in view of the journey I have undertaken would be
that you should join me as soon as possible. Then I should have the
benefit of your own and your friends’ protection, if I passed through
Epirus, after leaving Italy; and, if I chose any other course, I could
lay down fixed plans on your advice. So please be quick and join me. You
can the more easily do so as the bill about the province of Macedonia
has been passed. I would say more, if facts themselves did not speak for
me with you.

The reason why I moved was that there was nowhere where I could remain
unmolested except on Sicca’s estate, especially as the bill has not been
emended. Besides I noticed that I could get back to Brundisium from
there, if I had you with me. Without you I could not stay in those
districts on account of Autronius. Now, as I said in my last letter, if
you will come, I can take your advice on the whole matter. I know the
journey is an annoyance: but the whole of this miserable business is
full of annoyances. I can’t write any more, I am so down-hearted and
wretched. Take care of yourself. April 8, Nares in Lucania.

Please attribute my sudden departure from Vibo after asking you to join
me there to my misery rather than to caprice. I received a copy of the
bill for my destruction, and found that the alteration of which I had
heard, took the form of banishment beyond four hundred miles. Since I
could not go where I wished, I went straight to Brundisium before the
bill was passed; for fear of involving my host Sicca in my destruction
and because I am not permitted to stay at Malta. Now make haste and join
me; if I can find anyone to take me in. At present I receive kind
invitations: but I fear the future. I indeed, Pomponius, am heartily
sick of life: and it is mainly for your sake that I consented to live.

I arrived at Brundisium on April 17, and on the same day your men
delivered a letter from you. The next day but one some others brought me
another letter. I am very grateful for your kind invitation to stay at
your place in Epirus, though I expected it. It is a plan, which would
have just suited me, if I could have stayed there all the time. 1 hate a
crowd, I shun my fellow-men, I can hardly bear to look upon the light:
so the solitude there, especially as I am so at home there, would have
been far from unpleasant. But for stopping on the route it is too far
out of the way: moreover I should be only four days’ march from
Autronius and the rest, moreover you would not be there yourself. Yes, a
fortified place would be useful to me if I were settling there, but it
is unnecessary, when I am merely passing. If I dared, I should make for
Athens; and things were turning out right for it: but now my enemies are
there, you have not joined me, and I am afraid that town too may not be
counted far enough away from Italy. Nor have you let me know when I may
expect you.

Your pleas to me not to think of suicide have one result that I refrain
from laying violent hands on myself; but you cannot make me cease to
regret our decision and my existence. What is there for me to live for,
especially if I have lost even that hope I had when I set out? I will
forbear to mention all the miseries into which I have fallen through the
villainous machinations not so much of my enemies, as of

you to share it by sympathy. But this I will say, that no one has ever

any other time death will only end my pain, not heal it.

me of a change in affairs. That “everything” is very little: still,

Epirus, or proceed slowly through Candavia. My hesitation about Epirus
does not arise from my changefulness, but from doubts as to where I
shall see my brother. I don’t know where I shall see him, nor how I
shall tear myself from him. That is the chief and most pitiful of all my
miseries. I would write to you oftener and fuller, if grief had not

As I was setting out from Brundisium, I wrote to you, explaining why I
could not go to Epirus, because it is close to Achaia which is full of
my most virulent enemies, and it is a hard place to get out of, when I
want to start. My decision was confirmed by the receipt of two messages
at Dyrrachium, one saying that my brother was coming by sea from Ephesus
to

Athens, the other that he was coming by land through Macedonia. So I
sent a note to catch him at Athens, asking him to come on to
Thessalonica, and I myself set off and arrived at Thessalonica on the
23rd of May. The only certain news about him, that I have had, is that
he started a short time ago from Ephesus. Now I am in great anxiety to
know what is happening at Rome. It is true that in one letter dated May
15 you say you have heard that Quintus will be rigorously called in
question, and in another that things are calming down: but the latter is
dated a day before the former, to increase my perplexity. So, what
between my own personal grief, which racks and tortures me daily, and
this additional anxiety, I have hardly any life left in me. But the
passage was very bad and perhaps, not knowing where I was, he took some
other direction. My freedman Phaetho has seen nothing of him. Phaetho
was driven back by wind from Ilium to Macedonia and came to me at Pella.
I see how threatening the future is, though I have not the heart to
write. I am afraid of everything: there is no misfortune that does not
seem to fall to my lot. I am still staying in suspense at Thessalonica,
with this new fear added to the woes and sorrows that oppress me; and I
do not dare to make a move of any kind.

Now for the things you mention in your letter. Caecilius Trypho I have
not seen. Of your talk with Pompey I have heard from your letter. I
cannot see such signs of a political change as you either see or invent
to comfort me: for, if they take no notice of the Tigranes episode, all
hope is lost. You bid me pay my thanks to Varro. I will, and to Hypsaeus
too. I think I will follow your advice not to go any

to stop I have not yet made up my mind; and I am so anxious about
Quintus, that I can’t make up my mind to anything. But I will soon let
you know.

From these rambling notes of mine, you can see the perturbed state of my
wits. Yet, though I have been crushed by an incredible and unparalleled
misfortune, it is not so much my misery as the remembrance of my own
mistake that affects me. For now surely you see whose treachery egged me
on and betrayed me. Would to heaven you had seen it before, and had not
let a mistake dominate your mind as I did. So when you hear that I am
crushed and overwhelmed with grief, be assured that the sense of my
folly in trusting one, whose treachery I had not suspected, is a heavier
penalty than all the consequences. The thought of my misfortunes and my
fears for my brother prevent me from writing. Keep your eye on events
and your hand at the helm. Terentia expresses the deepest gratitude to
you. I have sent you a copy of the letter I wrote to Pompey.

My brother Quintus left Asia at the end of April and reached Athens on
May the 15th: and he had to hurry, for fear anything disastrous might
happen in his absence, if there were anyone who was not yet contented
with the measure of our woes. So I preferred him to hurry on to Rome
rather than to come to me: and besides—I will confess the

potui, ut aut illum amantissimum mei, mollissimo animo tanto in maerore
aspicerem aut meas miserias luctu adflictus[97] et perditam fortunam
illi offerrem aut ab illo aspici paterer. Atque etiam illud timebam,
quod profecto accidisset, ne a me digredi non posset. Versabatur mihi
tempus illud ante oculos, cum ille aut lictores dimitteret aut vi
avelleretur ex complexu meo. Huius acerbitatis eventum altera acerbitate
non videndi fratris vitavi. In hunc me casum vos vivendi auctores
impulistis. Itaque mei peccati luo poenas. Quamquam me tuae litterae
sustentant, ex quibus, quantum tu ipse speres, facile perspicio; quae
quidem tamen aliquid habebant solacii, antequam eo venisti a Pompeio,
“Nunc Hortensium allice et eius modi viros.” Obsecro, mi Pomponi, nondum
perspicis, quorum opera, quorum insidiis, quorum scelere perierimus? Sed
tecum haec omnia coram agemus; tantum dico, quod scire te puto, nos non
inimici, sed invidi perdiderunt. Nunc, si ita sunt, quae speras,
sustinebimus nos et spe, qua iubes, nitemur; sin, ut mihi videntur,

truth and it will show you the depth of my misery—I could not bear in my
great distress to look on one so devoted to me and so tender-hearted,
nor could I thrust upon him the misery of my affliction and my fallen
fortune, or suffer him to see me. Besides I was afraid of what would
have been sure to happen—that he would not be able to part from me. The
picture of the moment when he would have had to dismiss his lictors or
to be torn by force from my arms was ever before me. The bitterness of
parting I have avoided by the bitterness of not seeing my brother. That
is the kind of dilemma into which you who are responsible for my
survival have forced me; and so I have to pay the penalty for my
mistake. Your letter however cheers me, though I can easily see from it
how little hope you have yourself. Still it offered some little
consolation till you passed from your mention of Pompey to the passage:
“Now try to win over Hortensius and such people.” In heaven’s name, my
dear Pomponius, have you not yet grasped, whose agency, whose villainy
and whose treachery have ruined me? But that I will discuss when I meet
you. Now I will only say, what you must surely know, that it is not so
much my enemies as my enviers who have ruined me. If there is any real
foundation for your hopes, I will bear up and rely on the hope you
suggest. But if, as seems probable to me, your hopes are ill-founded,
then I will do now what you would not let me do before, though the time
is far less appropriate.

Terentia often expresses her gratitude to you. The thing I most fear
among all my misfortunes is my poor brother’s business: if I knew the
exact state of affairs, I might know what to do about it. I am

Your letter has posted me up in political news to May 25: and I am
awaiting the course of events at Thessalonica, as you suggest. When I
hear more, I shall know where to be. For if there is any excuse, if
anything is being done, if I see a ray of hope, I shall either wait here
or pay you a visit: but if, as you say in your letter, those hopes have
vanished into air I shall look for something else. At present you do not
give me the least hint of anything except the disagreement of those
friends of yours: and they are quarrelling about anything rather than
me, so I do not see what good it will do me. But, as long as you wish me
to hope, I will bow to your wishes. You frequently reproach me strongly
for weak-heartedness: but I should like to know if I have been spared
any hardship in my misfortune. Did anyone ever fall from such a high
estate in such a good cause, especially when he was so well endowed with
genius and good sense, so popular and so strongly supported by all
honest men? Can I forget what I was? Can I help feeling what I am? Can I
help missing my honour and fame, my children, my fortune and my brother?
That is a fresh misfortune for you to contemplate.

I have avoided seeing my brother, though I love him and always have
loved him better than myself, for fear that I should see him in his
grief and misery, or that I, from whom he had parted in the height of
prosperity, should present myself to him in ruin and humiliation. Of
other things too hard to bear, I will say nothing: my tears prevent me.
And what pray is it that calls for reproof? My grief, or my sin in not
retaining my position,—which would have been easy enough, if there had
not been a conspiracy for my ruin within my own walls,—or that I should
not have lost it without losing life too?

My object in wanting thus is to call for your ready sympathy, instead of
seeming to deserve your reproaches and reproofs, and the reason why I
write less than usual is partly that my sorrow prevents me, and partly

You lay great stress on the hopes I may entertain, especially of action
on the part of the Senate; yet at the same time you write that the
clause forbidding any mention of my case in the House is being posted
up. So no one opens his mouth. Then you accuse me of distressing myself,
though, as you know quite well, I have more reason for distress than
ever mortal had. You hold out hopes to me on the results of the

consul elect is my enemy? Your news too that my speech[98] has been

of my careworn appearance, a third relating the doings in the House, and
a fourth containing Varro’s confirmation of your opinion as to Pompey’s

not unhinged my mind: nay, I am even distressed that, though my mind is
so sound, I have neither place nor opportunity for using it. For, if you
feel the loss of a single friend like myself, what do you suppose my
feelings are, when I have lost you and every one else? And if you, on
whom no ban of outlawry has fallen, miss my presence, you can imagine
the aching void outlawry leaves in me. I will not mention all that I

Ceteros quos purgas, debent mihi probati esse, tibi si sunt. Sed haec
sero agimus.

Crassi libertum nihil puto sincere locutum. In senatu rem probe scribis
actam. Sed quid Curio? an illam orationem non legit? quae unde sit
prolata, nescio. Sed Axius eiusdem diei scribens ad me acta non ita
laudat Curionem. At potest ille aliquid praetermittere, tu, nisi quod
erat, profecto non scripsisti. Varronis sermo facit exspectationem
Caesaris. Atque utinam ipse Varro incumbat in causam! quod profecto cum
sua sponte tum te instante faciet.

Ego, si me aliquando vestri et patriae compotem fortuna fecerit, certe
efficiam, ut maxime laetere unus ex omnibus amicis, meaque officia et

have lost,—you know it well enough, and it would only open my wound
again. But this I do assert that no one has ever lost so much and no one
has ever fallen into such a depth of misery. Time too, instead of
lightening my grief, can but add to it: for other sorrows lose their
sting as time passes, but my sorrow can but grow daily, as I feel my
present misery and think on my past happiness. I mourn the loss not only
of my wealth and my friends but of my old self. For what am I now? But I
will not wring your soul with my complaints nor keep fingering my sore.

You write in defence of those who, I said, envied me and among them
Cato. Of him I have not the least suspicion: indeed I am sorry that the
false friendship of others had more weight with me than his loyalty. As
to the others I suppose I should acquit them if you do. But it is too
late to matter now.

I don’t think Crassus’ freedman meant what he said. You say things went
well in the House. But what about Curio? Hasn’t he read that speech?
Goodness knows how it got published. Axius however, writing on the same
day an account of the meeting, has less to say for Curio. Still he might
well miss something, while you would certainly not have written what was
not true. Varro’s talk with you gives me hopes of Caesar. I only wish
Varro himself would throw his weight into my cause; and I think he will
with a little pressing from you, if not of his own accord.

If ever I have the fortune to see you and my country again, I will not
fail to give you more cause for joy at my recall than all my other
friends: and, though I must confess that up to now my friendly
attentions have not been as conspicuous as they

casu maximo dolore esse adfectum sciam, sed profecto, si, quantum me
amas et amasti, tantum amare deberes ac debuisses, numquam esses passus
me, quo tu abundabas, egere consilio nec esses passus mihi persuaderi

cogitares, id abs te meo, non tuo scelere praetermissum est. Quodsi non

perterritum a turpissimo consilio revocaret, quod unus tu facere maxime
potuisti, aut occubuissem honeste, aut victores hodie viveremus. Hic

that I have been restored to you quite as much as to my brother and
children. If ever I have wronged you or rather for the wrongs that I
have done you, forgive me. I have wronged myself far more deeply. I do
not write this in ignorance of your great grief at my misfortune, but
because, if I had earned a right to all the affection you lavish and
have lavished on me, you would never have suffered me to stand in need
of that sound common sense of yours, and you would not have let me be
persuaded that it was to my interest to let the bill about the
guilds[101] be passed. But you, like myself, only gave your tears to my
distress, as a tribute of affection: and it was my fault, not yours,
that you did not devote day and night to pondering on the course I
should take, as you might have done, if my claims on you had been
stronger. If you or anyone had dissuaded me from the disgraceful resolve
I formed in my alarm at Pompey’s ungenerous reply,—and you were the
person best qualified to do so—I should either have died with honour, or
should to-day be living in triumph. You will pardon what I have said. I
am blaming myself far more than you, and you only as my second self, and
because I want a companion in my guilt. If I am restored, our common
guilt will seem far less, and you, at any rate, will hold me dear for
services rendered, not received, by you.

Footnote 101:

  The _Collegia_ were guilds for social, mercantile, or religious
  purposes. A decree had declared some of them illegal in 64 B.C.; but
  this was counteracted by a bill passed by Clodius in 58 B.C. The
  result was many new guilds were formed, which he used for political
  purposes.

Quod te cum Culleone scribis de privilegio locutum, est aliquid, sed
multo est melius abrogari. Si enim nemo impediet, sic est firmius; sin
erit, qui ferri non sinat, idem senatus consulto intercedet. Nec
quicquam aliud opus est abrogari; nam prior lex nos nihil laedebat. Quam
si, ut est promulgata, laudare voluissemus, aut, ut erat neglegenda,
neglegere, nocere omnino nobis non potuisset. Hic mihi primum meum
consilium defuit, sed etiam obfuit. Caeci, caeci, inquam, fuimus in

coeptum esset, fieri perniciosum fuit. Sed pergo praeterita, verum tamen
ob hanc causam, ut, si quid agetur, legem illam, in qua popularia multa
sunt, ne tangatis. Verum est stultum me praecipere, quid agatis aut quo

You mention talking to Culleo about this bill being directed against an
individual.[102] There is something in that point: but it is much better
to have it repealed. If no one vetoes it, it is by far the surest
course. If on the other hand anyone is opposed to it, he will veto the
Senate’s decree too. There is no necessity to repeal anything else as
well: the former law did not touch me. If we had had the sense to
support it when it was brought forward, or to take no notice of it,
which was all it deserved, it never would have done us any harm. It was
then I first lost the use of my wits, or rather used them to my own
destruction. It was blind, absolutely blind of us to put on mourning, to
appeal to the crowd—a fatal thing to do before I was attacked
personally. But I keep harping on what is over and done with. My point,
however, is to urge you, when you do make a move, not to touch that law
on account of its claims to popularity. But it is absurd of me to lay
down what you should do or how. If only something could be done! And on
that very point I am afraid your letters keep back a good deal, to save
me from giving way to even deeper despair. What course of action do you
suppose can be taken and how? Through the Senate? But you yourself have
told me that a clause of Clodius’ bill, forbidding any motion or
reference to my case, has been posted up in the House. How then does
Domitius propose to make a motion? And how is it that Clodius holds his
tongue, when the men you mention talk about the case and ask for a
motion? And, if you think

all the tribunes? What about my goods and chattels? What about my house?
Will they be restored? If not, how can I be? If you don’t see your way
to managing that, what is it you want me to hope for? And, if there is
nothing to hope for, what sort of life can I lead? Under these
circumstances I am awaiting the gazette for August 1 at Thessalonica,
before I make up my mind whether to take refuge on your estate, where I
can avoid seeing those I don’t want to see, and see you, as you point
out in your letter, and be nearer at hand if any action is being taken,
or whether I shall go to Cyzicus. I believe you and Quintus want me to
keep at hand.

Now, Pomponius, you used none of your wisdom in saving me from
ruin—either because you thought I had enough common sense myself, or
because you thought you owed me nothing but the support of your
presence: while I, basely betrayed and hurried to my ruin, threw down my
arms and fled, deserting my country, though all Italy would have stood
up and defended me with enthusiasm. You looked on in silence, while I
betrayed myself, my family and my possessions, to my enemies, though,
even if you had not more sense than I had, you certainly had less cause
for panic. Now, if you can, raise me from my fall, and in that render me
assistance. But, if all ways are blocked, let me know of the fact, and
do not keep on either reproaching me or offering us[103] your sympathy.
If I had any fault to find with your loyalty, I should not trust myself
to your house in preference to all

I am waiting for your letters of the first of August before I can decide

not, I shall make for Cyzicus, or take some other direction. The more

cheerful, they tone down any hope they raise, so that one can easily see

All the news I have had about my brother Quintus from June the 3rd to
the end of August has been bad news without exception. But on the last
of August Livineius, who had been sent by his former master, L. Regulus,
came to me. He assured me that no notice whatever had been given of a
prosecution though there was some talk of C. Clodius’ son undertaking
one: and he brought me letters from Quintus himself. But on the next day
came some of Sestius’ men, with some letters of yours which are not so
positive and alarming as Livineius’ conversation was. My own unending
distress of course renders me anxious, all the more so, as Appius would
preside at the trial.

From the rest of your remarks in the same letter as to my own chances, I
infer that our hopes are fainter than others make out. But since it will
not be long now before the matter is settled, I will either remove to
your house or still stay somewhere round here.

My brother writes that you alone are his support. I need not urge you to
efforts, which you make of your own accord, nor will I offer my thanks,
since you do not expect them. I only hope fate may allow us to enjoy our
affection in safety. I am always looking eagerly for your letters: and
please don’t be afraid either of boring me with your minuteness or
paining me by telling the truth.

You raised my hopes considerably by writing that Varro had assured you
as a friend that Pompey was going to take up my case, and that he would
appoint an agent as soon as he had received a letter which he was
expecting from Caesar. Did it come to nothing? Or was Caesar’s letter

the words “after the elections.”

Please do let me have full information as to the state of my case,—you

So long as your letters afforded me any ground for it, my hopes and my
longings kept me at Thessalonica: but, as soon as I saw that all
political business for this year had come to an end, I made up my mind
not to go to Asia, because I cannot put up with society and I do not
want to be far away in case the new magistrates should make a move. So I
determined to go to your house in Epirus, not that the

features of the place make any difference to me now that I shun the
light of day entirely, but I should like to sail back to freedom from a
port of yours, and, if that hope is cut off, I could not find a better
place either to drag on my miserable existence, or, what is preferable,
to end it. I shall have few people about me, and shall get free from
society.

Your letters never aroused my hopes as much as other people’s: and yet
my hopes were always fainter than your letters. However, since some kind
of a move has been made in the matter, whatever kind it may be and
whatsoever its cause, I will not disappoint either my dear and only
brother’s sad and touching entreaties, nor the promises of Sestius and
others, nor the appeals of my wife in her deep affliction and my little
Tullia in her misery, nor your own true-hearted letters. Epirus shall be
my road back to freedom or to what I mentioned before.

I beg and beseech you, Pomponius, as you see how I have been robbed of
my honours and of my dearest and fondest possessions by men’s treachery,

family, of your pity help me, and support my brother Quintus, who is not
past salvation: guard Terentia and my children; as for me, wait for me
in Rome, if you think there is any chance of seeing me there. If not,
come to see me, if you can, and allot me of your land enough for my body

fulfilment at your house in Epirus: but from letters I infer it would be
more convenient for me not to be in the same neighbourhood.

You are quite right about my house and Curio’s speech. If only
restoration is promised in general terms, everything else is comprised
in that word: and of all things I am most anxious about my house. But I
won’t enter into details: I trust myself entirely to your affection and
loyalty.

That you have freed yourself from all embarrassments in taking over your
large inheritance is exceedingly pleasant news to me; and I fully

what an assistance to me is your promise to devote all your resources to
my restoration, that I need not call on anyone else for help. I know too
that you are taking on your shoulders several men’s burdens on my
behalf, and that you are quite capable of bearing them, and will not
require asking to do so. You forbid me to imagine that it has ever
entered your head that I have done what I ought not or left undone what
I ought to have done in my dealings with you—well, I will humour you and
free my heart from that anxiety, but I shall count myself still deeper
in your debt, because your kindness to me has far exceeded mine to you.
Please send me news of everything you see or gather and of all that is
being done; and urge all your friends to support my return.

Sestius’ bill does not pay sufficient regard to dignity or caution. The
proposal should mention me by name, and contain a carefully worded
clause about my property. Please pay attention to that point.

Though my brother Quintus and Piso have sent me careful accounts of what
has been done, I am sorry you were too busy to write your usual full
description of events and of your surmises. Plancius’ kindness keeps me
here still, though I have several times tried to go to Epirus. He is
inspired with a hope, which I do not share, that we may return together:
which he hopes would redound to his honour. But now, as soon as news
arrives of the approach of the soldiers, I shall have to make an effort
to leave him. When I do, I will send word to you at once and let you
know where I am. The courtesy which Lentulus shows in his actions, his
promises and his letters, gives me some hope of Pompey’s good will: for
you have often mentioned that he would do anything for him. With
Metellus, my brother tells me, you have had as much success as he hoped.
My dear Pomponius, fight hard for me to be allowed to live with you and
with my family; and send me all the news. I am bowed down with grief
through my longing for all my dear ones, who have always been dearer to
me than myself. Take care of yourself.

Knowing that I should be a very long time without any news, if I went to
Epirus through Thessaly, and that the people of Dyrrachium were warm
friends of mine, I have come to them, after writing the first part of
this letter at Thessalonica. As soon as I leave here and go to your
house, I will let you know; and please write me every detail of
whatsoever kind. Now I look either for the fulfilment of my hopes or for
blank despair.

On the 26th of November I received three letters from you. In one of
them, posted on the 25th of October, you exhort me to keep up my courage
and wait for January, and you give a full list of all the hopeful signs,
Lentulus’ zeal for my cause, Metellus’ good will and Pompey’s policy.
One of the others is undated, which is unlike you; but you give a clear
clue to the time, for you say you were writing it on the very day that
the bill was published by the eight tribunes, that is to say the 29th of
October: and you state the advantages you think have resulted from the
publication of the law. If my restoration and this law together are long
past praying for, I hope your affection will make you regard the trouble
I am taking about it with pity rather than amusement. But, if there is
still some hope, please see to it that our new magistrates set up a more
careful case. For the old tribunes’ bill had three sections, and the one
about my return was carelessly worded; it does not provide for the
restitution of anything but my citizenship and my position. In my fallen
fortunes that is enough for me, but you cannot fail to see what ought to
have been stipulated and how. The second clause is the usual form of
indemnity: “If in virtue of this law there be any breach of other laws,”
etc.

But it is the third clause, Pomponius, to which I would call your
attention. What is its object, and who put it in? You know that Clodius
had so provided that it was almost, if not quite impossible for either
the Senate or the people to annul his law;

esset, nulla fere abrogari posset; neque enim ulla est, quae non ipsa se
saepiat difficultate abrogationis. Sed, cum lex abrogatur, illud ipsum
abrogatur, quo modo eam abrogari oporteat. Hoc cum et re vera ita sit,
et cum semper ita habitum observatumque sit, octo nostri tribuni pl.
caput posuerunt hoc: SI QVID IN HAC ROGATIONE SCRIPTVM EST, QVOD PER

POENAE MVLTAEVE SIT, E. H. L. N. R. Atque hoc in illis tribunis pl. non
laedebat; lege enim collegii sui non tenebantur. Quo maior est suspicio
malitiae alicuius, cum id, quod ad ipsos nihil pertinebat, erat autem
contra me, scripserunt, ut novi tribuni pl., si essent timidiores, multo
magis sibi eo capite utendum putarent. Neque id a Clodio praetermissum
est; dixit enim in contione a. d. III Nonas Novembres hoc capite
designates tribunis pl. praescriptum esse, quid liceret. Tamen in lege
nulla esse eius modi caput te non fallit, quod si opus esset, omnes in
abrogando uterentur. Ut Ninnium aut ceteros fugerit, investiges velim,
et quis attulerit, et quare octo tribuni pl. ad senatum de me referre
non dubitarint, scilicet[104] quod observandum illud caput non

Footnote 104:

  scilicet _Lallemand_; sive _MSS._

but, you see, the imprecations[105] attached to laws which are repealed
are never regarded, otherwise hardly any law ever would be repealed; for
there never is a law which did not hedge itself in with obstacles
against its repeal. But, when a law is repealed, the provisions against
repeal are repealed likewise. Though this is the case, and always has
been in theory and in practice, our eight tribunes have thought fit to
insert a clause: “If there be anything contained in this bill, which by
law or popular decree,” that is by Clodius’ law, “cannot now or
hereafter be brought forward, whether by way of proposal, repeal,
amendment or modification, without penalty, or without involving the
author of the proposal or amendment in a penalty or fine, no such
proposal is made in this law.” And yet these tribunes did not run any
risks; as a law made by one of their own body was not binding on them.
That increases my suspicion that there is some trickery about it, as
they have inserted a clause which does not apply to themselves, but is
against my interest; and as a result the new tribunes, if they should
happen to be rather timid, would suppose that clause still more
indispensable. Nor did Clodius overlook the point: for in the meeting on
November the third he said that this clause defined the powers of the
tribunes elect. Yet you know quite well that no such clause is ever
inserted in a law: and, if it were necessary, everybody would use it
when repealing a law. Please try to find out how this clause escaped the
notice of Ninnius and the rest, also who inserted it, and why the eight
tribunes, after showing no hesitation about bringing my case before the
House—which proves they did not think

perdidi, neve quid eum patiare gravius consulere de se, quam expediat

that section need be taken seriously—yet when it came to repealing the
law, became so cautious that they feared a rule, which even those who
are bound by the law do not regard, though they themselves were not
bound by it. That clause I would rather the new tribunes did not
propose; but do let them pass something—anything. I shall be quite
contented with a single clause of recall, if only the matter can be
settled. For some time past I have been ashamed of writing such long
letters. For by the time you read this I am afraid that there may be no
hope left, and that all my trouble may serve only to make you pity and
others laugh. But, if there is any hope left, look at the bill which
Visellius has drawn up for Fadius: it takes my fancy very much, whereas
our friend Sestius’ proposal, which you say has your approval, does not
please me at all.

The third letter is dated November 12, and in it you go through the
reasons which you think are causing delay in my case, thoughtfully and
carefully, mentioning Crassus, Pompey and the rest. Now, if there is the
least chance of getting the matter settled by the good offices and
authority of the conservatives and by getting a large mass of
supporters, for heaven’s sake try to break the barrier down at a rush:
devote yourself to it and incite others to join. But if, as I infer from
your guesses as well as mine, there is no hope left, then I beg and pray
you to cherish my poor brother Quintus, whom I have involved in my own
ruin, and not to let him pursue any rash course which would endanger
your sister’s son. Watch over my poor little boy, to whom I leave
nothing but the hatred and the disgrace of my name, so far as you can,
and support Terentia with your kindness in her

When you wrote to me some time ago that the estimates for the consular
provinces[106] were passed with your consent, I hoped you saw some good
reason or other for that course, though I was afraid of the result: but
now that I have been told by word of mouth and by letter that your
policy was severely criticized, I am much disturbed at seeing the faint
hope I had apparently taken from me. For, if the tribunes are annoyed
with us, what hope is left? And they seem to me to have every reason for
annoyance, when they were left out of the plan, though they had espoused
my cause, and by our concession they have lost all use of their just
right, especially as they assert that it was for my sake they wished to
exercise their powers in fitting out the consuls, with a view not to
oppose them but to attach them to my cause. But now if the consuls
choose to stand aloof from me, they are perfectly free to do so, while,
if they take my part, they can do nothing against the tribunes’ will. As
for your writing that, if you had

  _Ornare consules_ or _provincias_ is the phrase used of the
  arrangement of the number of troops, the staff, and the amount of
  money to be granted to each consul, when going he went to his
  province. It generally took place after they came into office; but for
  some reason it had been arranged earlier on this occasion.

illos hoc idem per populum adsecuturos fuisse, invitis tribunis pl.

Accedit aliud non parvum incommodum, quod gravis illa opinio, ut quidem
ad nos perferebatur, senatum nihil decernere, antequam de nobis actum
esset, amissa est, praesertim in ea causa, quae non modo necessaria non
fuit, sed etiam inusitata ac nova (neque enim umquam arbitror ornatas
esse provincias designatorum), ut, cum in hoc illa constantia, quae erat
mea causa suscepta, imminuta sit, nihil iam possit non decerni. Iis, ad
quos relatum est, amicis placuisse non mirum est; erat enim difficile
reperire, qui contra tanta commoda duorum consulum palam sententiam
diceret. Fuit omnino difficile non obsequi vel amicissimo homini
Lentulo, vel Metello, qui simultatem humanissime deponeret; sed vereor,
ne hos tamen tenere potuerimus, tribunos pl. amiserimus. Haec res quem

not assented, they would have got their way all the same through the
people, that could never have happened, if the tribunes opposed it. So I
am afraid that I have lost the tribunes’ favour, and that, if it is
still retained, the bond which should have united the consuls with them
has been lost.

There is another considerable disadvantage too. There was a strong
opinion, or so at least it was reported to me, that the Senate would not
pass any measure until my case was settled. That is now lost, and in a
case where there was no necessity whatever; indeed the proceeding was
unusual and unprecedented. For I do not think the estimates for the
provinces were ever passed before the consuls entered on their office.
The result is that, now that the firm resolution formed in favour of my
case has been broken for this one occasion, there is no reason why any
decree should not be passed. I don’t wonder that those friends to whom
the question was referred agreed to it: it would of course have been
difficult to find anyone who would openly oppose a measure so favourable
to the two consuls. It would have been very difficult too not to oblige
so good a friend as Lentulus, or Metellus, considering his kindness in
laying aside his quarrel with me. But I am afraid that, while we could
have retained their friendship in any case, we have thrown away that of
the tribunes. Please write and tell me what the result has been, and how
my whole case stands, as freely as you have before. For, however
unpleasant the truth may be, I am grateful for it.

myself of the Senate’s expressed opinion, preferring to be deprived of
my life rather than of my native land. Please make haste and come to me.

As soon as I reached Rome and there was anyone to whom I could safely
entrust a letter to you, my first thought was to write and thank you for
my return, since you are not here to receive my thanks. For I grasped,
to tell you the truth, that though in the advice you gave me you showed
yourself no wiser and no braver than myself, and indeed, considering my
past attentions to you, you were none too energetic in defence of my
honour, still, though at first you shared my mistake or rather my
madness and my unnecessary fright, it was you who took my exile most to
heart and contributed most energy, zeal and perseverance in bringing
about my return. And so I can assure you that in the midst of great
rejoicing and the most gratifying congratulations, one thing was lacking
to fill the cup of my happiness, the sight of you or rather your
embrace. When once I have obtained that, I shall certainly think myself
undeserving of this renewal of good fortune, if ever I let you go again,
and if I do not exact to the full all arrears in the enjoyment of your
pleasant society.

As regards my political position, I have attained what I thought would
be the hardest thing to recover—my distinction at the Bar, my authority
in the House and more popularity with the sound party than I desire. But
you know how my private property has been crippled, dissipated,
plundered. I

fracta, dissipata, direpta sit, non ignoras, valde laboramus tuarumque
non tam facultatum, quas ego nostras esse iudico, quam consiliorum ad
colligendas et constituendas reliquias nostras indigemus.

Nunc, etsi omnia ant scripta esse a tuis arbitror aut etiam nuntiis ac
rumore perlata, tamen ea scribam brevi, quae te puto potissimum ex meis
litteris velle cognoscere. Pr. Nonas Sextiles Dyrrachio sum profectus
ipso illo die, quo lex est lata de nobis. Brundisium veni Nonis
Sextilibus. Ibi mihi Tulliola mea fuit praesto, natali suo ipso die, qui
casu idem natalis erat et Brundisinae coloniae et tuae vicinae Salutis;
quae res animadversa a multitudine summa Brundisinorum gratulatione
celebrata est. Ante diem VI Idus Sextiles cognovi, cum Brundisi essem,
litteris Quinti mirifico studio omnium aetatum atque ordinum,
incredibili concursu Italiae legem comitiis centuriatis esse perlatam.
Inde a Brundisinis honestissimis ornatus, iter ita feci, ut undique ad
me cum gratulatione legati convenerint. Ad urbem ita veni, ut nemo
ullius ordinis homo nomenclatori notus fuerit, qui mihi obviam non
venerit, praeter eos inimicos, quibus id ipsum, se inimicos esse, non
liceret aut dissimulare aut negare. Cum venissem ad portam Capenam,
gradus templorum ab infima plebe completi erant. A qua plausu maximo cum
esset mihi gratulatio significata, similis et frequentia et plausus me
usque ad Capitolium celebravit, in foroque et in ipso Capitolio miranda
multitudo fuit.

am in great difficulties with it and stand in need not so much of your
means, which I know I can look upon as my own, as of your advice to
gather the fragments together and arrange matters.

Now, though I suppose you have had all the news from your family or from
messengers and rumour, I will give you a short account of everything I
think you would rather learn from my letters. On the 4th of August, the
very day the law about me was proposed, I started from Dyrrachium, and
arrived at Brundisium on the 5th. There my little Tullia was waiting for
me, on her own birthday, which; as it happened, was the commemoration
day of Brundisium and of the temple of Safety near your house too. The
coincidence was noticed and the people of Brundisium held great
celebrations. On the 8th of August, while I was still at Brundisium, I
heard from Quintus that the law had been passed in the Comitia
Centuriata with extraordinary enthusiasm of all ages and ranks in Italy
who had flocked to Rome in thousands. Then I started on my journey amid
the rejoicings of all the loyal folk of Brundisium, and was met
everywhere by deputations offering congratulations. When I came near the
city, there was not a soul of any class known to my attendant,[108] who
did not come to meet me, except those enemies who could neither hide nor
deny their enmity. When I reached the Capenan Gate, the steps of the
temples were thronged with the populace. Their joy was exhibited in loud
applause: a similar crowd accompanied me with like applause to the
Capitol, and in the Forum and on the very Capitol there was an
extraordinary gathering.

Next day, on the 5th of September, I returned thanks to the Senate[110]
in the House. On those two days bread was very dear and crowds ran first
to the theatre and then to the House, crying out at Clodius’ instigation
that the dearth of corn was my fault. On the same days there were
meetings of the House about the corn supply and Pompey was called upon
by poor and rich alike to take the matter in hand. He was more than
willing; and the people asked me by name to propose it: so I delivered
my opinion carefully. As the ex-consuls, except Messalla and Afranius,
were absent, thinking it was not safe to record a vote, a decree was
passed in accordance with my proposal that Pompey should be appealed to
take the matter in hand and a law should be passed. When this bill was
read out, the people received the mention of my name with applause after
the new silly fashion: and I delivered an harangue, with the permission
of all the magistrates present, except one praetor and two tribunes. On
the next day there was a full House and all the ex-consuls were willing
to grant Pompey anything. He asked for a committee of fifteen, naming me
at the head of them and saying that I should count as his second self in
everything. The consuls drew up a law giving Pompey the direction of the
whole corn supply in the world for five years: Messius another granting
him the control of the treasury, and adding an army and a fleet and
higher powers than those of the local officials in the provinces. The
law we ex-consuls proposed is regarded now as quite moderate, this

of Messius as perfectly intolerable. Pompey says he prefers the former;
his friends that he prefers the latter. Favonius is leading the consular
party who rebel against it, while I hold my peace, especially as the
pontifices at present have given no answer about my house. If they annul
the consecration, I shall have a splendid site. The consuls will value
the building according to the decree of the Senate; if not, they will
pull it down, lease it out in their own name, and reckon up the whole
cost.

My monetary affairs, as you know, are in an awful muddle: and there are
some private matters which I won’t commit to writing. I am devoted to my
brother Quintus as his extraordinary affection, virtue and loyalty
deserve. I am looking forward to your coming and beg you to come soon,
and to come resolved to give me the full benefit of your advice. I am
standing at the threshold of a new life. Already those who took my part
in my exile are beginning to feel annoyance at my presence, though they
disguise it, and to envy me without even taking the trouble to disguise
that. I really stand in urgent need of you.

Post illas datas litteras secuta est summa contentio de domo. Diximus

umquam in dicendo fuimus aliquid, aut etiam si numquam alias fuimus, tum

desideras, tamen mittam cito. Cum pontifices decressent ita, SI NEQVE

quam Appius ei dedit. Nuntiat iam populo pontifices secundum se
decrevisse, me autem vi conari in possessionem venire; hortatur, ut se
et Appium sequantur et suam Libertatem vi defendant. Hic cum etiam illi
infirmi partim admirarentur, partim irriderent hominis amentiam, ego
statueram illuc non accedere, nisi

busy, no press of work could be sufficient to break the course of our
affection or of my duty to you. Since I have come to Rome, this is the
second time that I have heard of a messenger, and so this is the second
letter I send.

In my former I described the sort of return I had, my position and the
state of all my affairs:

             “For happy though but ill, for ill not worst.”

After I sent that letter, there followed a great fight about my house. I
delivered a speech[112] before the pontifices on the 29th of September.
I bestowed great pains on the matter, and, if ever I had any oratorical
ability, or even if I never had before, on that occasion at any rate, my
great indignation lent some vigour to my style. So its publication is a
debt which I must not leave unpaid to the rising generation: and to you
I will send it very soon, whether you want it or not. The pontifices
decreed that “if the party alleging that he had dedicated had not been
appointed by name either by order of the people or vote of the plebs,
and if he had not been commanded to do so, either by order of the people
or by vote of the plebs then it appeared that that part of the site
might be restored to me without sacrilege,” I was congratulated at once,
everybody thinking that the house had been adjudged to me. But all of a
sudden up gets a man to speak, at Appius’ invitation, and announces that
the pontifices have decided in his favour and I am trying to take
possession by force: he exhorts them to follow him and Appius and defend
their shrine of Liberty. Thereupon, though even those pliable persons
were partly lost in wonder and partly laughing at the man’s folly, I
determined

erant senatores. A quibus Marcellinus, qui erat cupidissimus mei,

Tum M. Lucullus de omnium collegarum sententia respondit religionis

religione statuisse, in senatu de lege statuturos cum senatu. Itaque suo
quisque horum loco sententiam rogatus multa secundum causam nostram
disputavit. Cum ad Clodium ventum est, cupiit diem consumere, neque ei

not to go near the place until the consuls by decree of the Senate had
given out the contract for restoring the porch of Catulus. On the first
of October there was a full meeting of the Senate. All the pontifices
who were senators were summoned: and Marcellinus, a strong partisan of
mine, being called upon first for his opinion, asked them what was the
purport of their decree. Then M. Lucullus speaking for all his
colleagues answered, that the pontifices had to decide points of
religion and the Senate points of law: he and his colleagues had settled
the religious point and now in the Senate they would join the other
senators in settling the legal point. Accordingly as each of them was
called upon in his turn, he delivered a long speech in my favour. When
it came to Clodius, he wanted to waste the whole day and spoke on
endlessly, but at last, after speaking for nearly three hours, he was
forced by the indignant outcry of the Senate to wind up his speech. A
decree was passed in accordance with Marcellinus’ proposal with only one
dissentient voice: and then Serranus put his veto on it. Both consuls at
once referred the veto to the Senate, and many resolute speeches were
delivered: “that the Senate approved of the restitution of my house,”
“that a contract should be drawn up for the portico of Catulus,” “that
the Senate’s resolution should be supported by all the magistrates,”
“that if any violence occurred, the Senate would hold him responsible
who had vetoed its decree.” Serranus showed the white feather and
Cornicinus played the same old farce: he threw off his toga and flung
himself at his son-in-law’s feet. Serranus demanded a night to think it
over. They would not grant it, remembering the first of January. At last
with my

nostrique facias.

Quoniam, acta quae sint, habes, de reliqua nostra cogitatione cognosce.
Ego me a Pompeio legari ita sum passus, ut nulla re impedirer. Quod nisi
vellem mihi esset integrum, ut, si comitia censorum proximi consules
haberent, petere possem, votivam legationem sumpsissem prope omnium
fanorum, lucorum; sic enim nostrae rationes utilitatis meae postulabant.
Sed volui meam potestatem esse vel petendi vel ineunte

consent the concession was unwillingly made. On the next day the decree
which I send was passed. Then the consuls gave out the contract for the
restoration of the portico of Catulus; and the contractors immediately
pulled down that portico of his to everybody’s satisfaction. The consuls
valued my house at nearly £18,000[113] at their assessor’s advice: and
the other things very stingily—my Tusculan villa at £4,400 and my
Formian at £2,200.[114] This estimate was violently decried not only by
all the conservative party, but by the people too. If you ask me the
reason, they say it was my bashfulness, as I did not refuse or make
pressing demands. But that is not the reason; for that in itself would
have counted for me. But the fact is, my dear Pomponius, those very same
men—you know quite well who I mean—who cut my wings, do not wish them to
grow again. But I hope they are growing. Do you only come to me. But I
fear you may be delayed by the visit of your and my friend Varro.

There you have all that has happened. Now you shall dip into my
thoughts. I have let myself be appointed legate to Pompey with a
reservation that it should not hamper me at all. If I did not want to
have a free hand to stand for the censorship, if the next consuls hold a
censorial election, I would have taken a votive commission[115] to
nearly any shrines or groves. For that was what suited my idea of my
interests best. But I wanted to be free either to stand for election or
to quit the city at the beginning of summer and meanwhile I thought it
good policy

On the 3rd of November the workmen were driven out of my building-ground
by armed assault: the porch of Catulus, which was being repaired on a
contract made by the consuls in accordance with a decree of

the Senate, and had nearly got as high as the roof, was knocked down: my
brother Quintus’ house was first smashed by a discharge of stones from
my plot, and then set on fire under Clodius’ orders by firebrands hurled
before the eyes of the whole city, amidst the groans and growls—I will
not say of the loyal party, which seems to have vanished out of
existence—but simply of every human creature. He was rushing about in a
frenzy, thinking of nothing but the slaughter of his enemies after this
mad freak, and canvassing the city quarter by quarter, openly promising
liberation to slaves. Before this, when he was trying to shirk his
trial, he had a case hard indeed to support and obviously wrongful, but
still it was a case: he could deny things, he could put the blame on
others, he could even plead that he had the right on his side in some
respects. But after this wreckage, arson and pillage, his own supporters
have left him in the lurch and he hardly has a hold now even on Decimus
the marshal, or Gellius: he has to take slaves into his confidence and
sees, that if he openly commits all the murders he wishes to commit, his
case before the court will not be one whit worse than it is now. So, on
the 11th of November, as I was going down the Sacred Way, he followed me
with his gang. There were shouts, stones, clubs, swords, all without a
moment’s warning. We stepped aside into Tettius Damio’s hall: and those
who were with me easily prevented his roughs from entering. He might
have been killed himself: but I have got tired of surgery and am
beginning a regime cure. He realized that there was a universal outcry
not for his prosecution but for his execution, and has since behaved in
such a way that a Catiline looks ultraconservative

beside him. For on the 12th of November he attempted to storm and burn
Milo’s house—the one on the Cermalus—openly bringing men with shields
and drawn swords and others with lighted torches to the spot at eleven
o’clock in the morning. His own headquarters during the assault were P.
Sulla’s house. Then Q. Flaccus led forth a gallant band from Milo’s
family house and slew the most notorious of Clodius’ troop of ruffians.
He wanted to slay Clodius himself: but he was skulking in the recesses
of Sulla’s house. There followed a meeting of the Senate on the 14th:
Clodius stayed at home: Marcellinus behaved splendidly: and everybody
was enthusiastic. Metellus with the assistance of Appius and, mark you,
your great friend[118] of whose constancy you sent me such a veracious
account, tried the ruse of talking the time away. Sestius was furious,
Clodius afterwards vowed vengeance on the city, if his election did not
take place. Marcellinus posted up his resolution which he had in writing
when he delivered it—it provided that my entire case should be included
in the trial, the attack on my building ground, the arson and the
assault on my person, and that all these should precede the election—and
Milo gave notice that he intended to watch the sky for omens on all the
election days.

Disorderly meetings were held by Metellus, wild meetings by Appius and
raging mad meetings by Publius. But the end of it all was that the
elections would have taken place, if Milo had not reported evil omens in
the Campus Martius. On the 19th of November Milo took up his position in
the Campus before midnight with a large force; while Clodius in spite of

his picked gangs of runaway slaves did not venture to show himself. Milo
to the huge delight of everybody and to his own great credit stayed
there till midday: and the three brethren’s struggle ended in disgrace,
their strength broken and their mad pride humbled. Metellus; however,
demands that the prohibition should be repeated in the forum on the next
day. There was no necessity, he said, for Milo to come to the Campus at
night; he would be in the Comitium at six in the morning. So on the 20th
Milo went to the Comitium in the early hours of the morning. At daybreak
Metellus came sneaking into the Campus by something like byepaths. Milo
catches the fellow up “between the groves”[120] and serves his notice:
and he retired amid loud jeers and insults from Q. Flaccus. The 21st was
a market-day, and for two days there were no meetings.

It is now three o’clock on the morning of the 23rd as I am writing. Milo
has already taken possession of the Campus. Marcellus, the candidate, is
snoring loud enough for me to hear him next door. I have just had news
that Clodius’ hall is utterly deserted, save for a few rag and bob tails
with a canvas lantern. His side are complaining that I am at the bottom
of it all: but they little know the courage and wisdom of that hero. His
valour is marvellous. I can’t stop to mention some of his new strokes of
genius. But this is the upshot: I believe the elections will not be
held, and Milo will bring Publius before the bar, unless he kills him
first. If he gives him a chance in a riot, I can see Milo will kill him
with his own hands. He has got no scruples

well, and those make wry faces who are annoyed to see me occupy a villa
which used to belong to Catulus, forgetting that I bought it from
Vettius; and who declare I ought not to have built a house, but ought to
have sold the site. That however is nothing compared with their unholy

the same reason as Saufeius and your Epicurean friends, but because he
was so true a patriot that it seems as though a merciful providence had
snatched him from his country’s fiery ruin. For what could be more
shameful than the life we are all leading, especially myself? You, in
spite of a political bent, have avoided wearing any special yoke; but
you share the universal bondage. But think of the sufferings I undergo,
when I am taken for a lunatic, if I say what I ought about the State,
for a slave, if I say what expediency dictates, and for a cowed and
helpless bondsman, if I hold my tongue. I suffer as you may suppose,

ungrateful. Well! why shouldn’t I take a rest, and flee to the haven of
retirement? I haven’t the chance. Then be it war and camp. And so I must
be a subaltern, after refusing to be a captain. So be it. That I see is
your opinion, and I wish I had always followed your advice. Hobson’s

About Trebonius I heartily agree with you. As for Domitius, his
_dénouement_ was as like mine as two peas; the same persons had a hand
in it, it was equally unexpected, and the conservative party deserted us
both. There is only one point of difference: he deserved his fate.
Perhaps my fall was the less hard to bear. For what could be more
humiliating than for one, who all his life long has looked forward to
the consulship as his birth-right, to fail to obtain it—and that too
when there is no one or at most only one other candidate standing
against him? But, if it is true that our friend[134] has in his

Your letter was the first to give me information about Natta: I could
never abide the man. You ask about my poem. Well, what if it wants to
take wing? Will you let it? I had begun to mention Fabius Luscus: he was
always a great admirer of mine, and I never disliked him, for he was
intelligent enough and very worthy and unassuming. As I had not seen him
for a long time, I thought he was away: but I hear from this fellow
Gavius of Firmum that the man is in Rome and has been here all along. It
struck me as odd. You will say it is an insignificant trifle. But he had
told me a good many things, of which there was no doubt, about those
brothers from Firmum: and what has made him shun me, if he has shunned
me, I cannot imagine.

Your advice to act diplomatically and not to steer too close to the

wisdom; so, as usual, I shall draw on you. Please scent out anything you

dry, and write to me every day about these points and anything else.

thinking. I met Pompey here; and he told me a lot of political news. He
was very dissatisfied with himself, as he said—for that is a necessary
proviso in his case. Of Syria he expressed a very low opinion, while he
runs down[137] Spain—with the same proviso “as he said,” which I think
must be inserted everywhere when he is mentioned, like the tag “this too
is by Phocylides.” To you he expressed his thanks for undertaking the
arrangement of the statues, and he laid himself out to be most
uncommonly pleasant to me. He even came to visit me in my house at
Cumae. The last thing he seemed to wish was that Messalla should stand
for the consulship: and if you have any information on that point, I
should like to know it.

together to settle accounts with the tax-gatherers. I asked, “During the

this pother. I am ravenous for news, and, to tell you the truth, I

start[144] in his uniform than L. Paulus of old, who rivalled him in age

Vestorius noster me per litteras fecit certiorem te Roma a. d. VI Idus
Maias putari profectum esse tardius, quam dixeras, quod minus valuisses.
Si iam melius vales, vehementer gaudeo. Velim domum ad te scribas, ut
mihi tui libri pateant non secus, ac si ipse adesses, cum ceteri tum
Varronis. Est enim mihi utendum quibusdam rebus ex his libris ad eos,
quos in manibus habeo; quos, ut spero, tibi valde probabo. Tu velim, si
quid forte novi habes, maxime a Quinto fratre, deinde a C. Caesare, et
si quid forte de comitiis, de re publica (soles enim tu haec festive
odorari), scribas ad me; si nihil habebis, tamen scribas aliquid.
Numquam enim mihi tua epistula aut intempestiva aut loquax visa est.
Maxime autem rogo, rebus tuis totoque itinere ex sententia confecto nos
quam primum revisas. Dionysium iube salvere. Cura, ut valeas.

Our friend Vestorius has informed me by letter that you are believed to
have left Rome on the 10th of May, later than you said you would,
because you had not been quite well. I sincerely hope you are better
now. Would you please write home telling them to give me the run of your
books, more especially of Varro, just as though you were there? I shall
have to use some passages from those books for the works I have in hand,
which I hope will meet with your hearty approval. I should be glad if
you would let me know, if you happen to have any news, from my brother
Quintus particularly, or from C. Caesar, or anything about the elections
and politics—you generally have a pretty scent for such things. If you
have no news, write something anyhow: for no letter of yours ever seemed
ill-timed or long-winded to me. But above all pray come back as soon as
possible, when your business and your tour are completed to your
satisfaction. Give my regards to Dionysius. Take care of yourself.

I am glad to hear about Eutychides. Taking your old name and your new

account, and that his sympathy with me in my sorrow was not lost on me
at the time nor forgotten afterwards.

I suppose your journey to Asia is inevitable; for you would never want
to put such a distance between yourself and all your nearest and dearest
friends and possessions without very good reason. But you will show your
consideration and your love for your friends by the quickness with which
you return. I am however afraid the attractions of the rhetorician
Clodius and the reputed deep learning of Pituanius, who just now is
devoted to Greek literature, may keep you from returning. But, if you
would prove yourself a good man and true, find your way back to us by
the date you promised. You can live with them when they get safely to
Rome.

You say you are longing for a line of some sort from me. I have written
a letter full of news, with everything described as in a diary, but I
suppose it was never delivered, as you don’t seem to have stopped long
in Epirus. Besides my letters are generally not of a kind that I like to
give to anyone, unless I can be sure he will deliver them to you.

Now I will tell you the news of the town. On the 4th of July Sufenas and
Cato were acquitted, Procilius condemned. That shows us that our lights
of the law care not a straw for bribery, elections, a political
deadlock, treason or the country in general. They prefer one not to
murder a father of a family in his own home; but even that preference
has no overwhelming majority in its favour: for 22 voted for acquittal
against 28 for condemnation. Publius no doubt had awakened the sympathy
of the jury by his eloquent peroration for the prosecution. Hortalus was
retained and behaved as usual. I did not utter

cuius modi solet. Nos verbum nullum; verita est enim pusilla, quae nunc
laborat, ne animum Publi offenderem. His rebus actis Reatini me ad sua

decem legatos, quod lacus Velinus a M’. Curio emissus interciso monte in
Nar defluit; ex quo est illa siccata et umida tamen modice Rosia. Vixi

Redii Romam Fontei causa a. d. VII Idus Quinct. Veni spectatum primum
magno et aequabili plausu. Sed hoc ne curaris. Ego ineptus, qui
scripserim. Deinde Antiphonti operam. Is erat ante manu missus quam

nihil tam sine voce, nihil tam.... Verum haec tu tecum habeto. In

iunxerunt, qua pactione, epistulae committere non audeo, Pompeius
fremit, queritur, Scauro

a word: for my little girl, who is ill, was afraid I might offend
Publius. After all this the people of Reate took me to their “banks and
braes” to plead their cause against the Interamnates before the consul
and ten commissioners, because the Veline lake, drained by the channel
cut by M’. Curius through the mountain,[147] flowed into the Nar. By
this means the famous Rosia has been dried up, though it is still
moderately damp. I stayed with Axius, who took me for a visit to the
Seven Waters too.

For Fonteius’ sake I returned to Rome on the 9th of July. I went to the
theatre and was greeted with loud and unbroken applause—but don’t bother
about that: I am a fool to mention it. Then I gave my attention to
Antiphon. He was granted his freedom before he appeared: and, not to
keep you in suspense, he won his laurels. But there never was such a
little weakling with so little voice and so.... But keep that to
yourself. However in the Andromache he was taller than Astyanax: among
the rest there was no one of his size. You want to know next about
Arbuscula: she pleased me very much. The games were magnificent and much
liked. The wild beast hunt was put off till later.

Now follow me to the election field. There is an outburst of bribery.
More by token, the rate of interest has risen from 4 per cent to 8 per
cent since the 15th of July. You will say: “Well, I can put up with that
at any rate.” And you call yourself a man and a patriot! Memmius is
supported by all Caesar’s influence. The consuls have coupled him with
Domitius in an agreement which I dare not commit to paper. Pompey is
raging and growling and backing

esset, id perderet et competitoribus tribueretur.

Maeciam. Pugnatur acriter; agitur tamen satis. Deinde me expedio ad
Drusum, inde ad Scaurum. Parantur orationibus indices gloriosi. Fortasse
accedent etiam consules designati. In quibus si Scaurus non fuerit, in
hoc iudicio valde laborabit.

Scaurus; but whether ostensibly or in earnest is more than one can say.
None of them is romping ahead: money levels all their ranks. Messalla is
not in the running, not that his heart or his friends have failed him,
but the coalition of the consuls and Pompey are both against him. I
think the elections will have to be postponed. The candidates for the
tribunate have taken an oath to submit their conduct to Cato’s approval,
and have deposited £4,400[149] with him on the condition that any one of
them who is condemned by Cato shall lose it and it shall be given to his
rivals.

I am writing this the day before the elections are expected to come off.
But on the 28th I will give you a full account of them, if they have
taken place and the messenger has not started. If they really are
conducted without bribery, which people think will be the case, then
Cato alone will have done more than all the laws and all the law courts
can do. I am acting for Messius, who has been recalled from his office.
Appius had given him a commission on Caesar’s staff: but Servilius
issued a warrant requiring his presence. The tribes he has to face are
the Pomptine, Veline and Maecian. It is a sharp struggle, however it is
getting on fairly well. Then I have to get ready for Drusus and after
that for Scaurus. These will make grand titles for my speeches. I may
even have the names of the consuls elect to add to the list; and, if
Scaurus is not one of them, he will find himself in serious difficulties
in this trial.

From my brother Quintus’ letters I suspect he is now in Britain, and I
am very anxious to know how he is getting on. One point I have certainly
gained:

The bare fact that my letter is by the hand of an amanuensis will show
you how busy I am. I have nothing to grumble about as regards the
frequency of your letters, but most of them merely told me where you
were. That they were from you showed, too, that you were well. The two
of this sort which gave me the most pleasure were those dated almost
simultaneously from Buthrotum: for I was anxious to know whether you had
a good crossing. But it is more the regularity of this constant supply
of letters which has pleased me than the richness of their contents. The
one that your guest M. Paccius delivered was of importance and full of
matter: so I will answer that. The first thing is that I have shown
Paccius, both by word and by deed, the weight a recommendation from you
carries. Accordingly he is among my intimate friends now, though I did
not know him before.

Now for the rest. You mention Varro: I will try and get him in
somewhere, if I can find a place. But you know the style of my
Dialogues: just as in those _On the Orator_, which you laud to the
skies, I could not let the interlocutors mention anyone except persons
they had known or heard of, so here too in the dialogue _On the
Republic_ which I have begun, I

quam institui, disputationem in Africani personam et Phili et Laeli et
Manili contuli. Adiunxi adulescentes Q. Tuberonem, P. Rutilium, duo
Laeli generos, Scaevolam et Fannium. Itaque cogitabam, quoniam in
singulis libris utor prohoemiis ut Aristoteles in iis, quos ἐξωτερικοὺς

intellego tibi placere. Utinam modo conata efficere possim! Rem enim,
quod te non fugit, magnam complexus sum et gravem et plurimi otii, quo
ego maxime egeo.

Quod in iis libris, quos laudas, personam desideras Scaevolae, non eam
temere dimovi: sed fecit idem in πολιτείᾳ deus ille noster Plato. Cum in
Piraeum Socrates venisset ad Cephalum, locupletem et festivum senem,
quoad primus ille sermo habetur, adest in disputando senex, deinde, cum
ipse quoque commodissime locutus esset, ad rem divinam dicit se velle
discedere neque postea revertitur. Credo Platonem vix putasse satis
consonum fore, si hominem id aetatis in tam longo sermone diutius
retinuisset. Multo ego magis hoc mihi cavendum putavi in Scaevola, qui
et aetate et valetudine erat ea, qua eum esse meministi, et iis
honoribus, ut vix satis decorum videretur eum plures dies esse in Crassi
Tusculano. Et erat primi libri sermo non alienus a Scaevolae studiis,
reliqui libri τεχνολογίαν habent, ut scis. Huic ioculatorem senem illum,
ut noras, interesse sane nolui.

have put the discussion in the mouths of Africanus, Philus, Laelius and
Manilius, adding the youths Q. Tubero, P. Rutilius and the two
sons-in-law of Laelius, Scaevola and Fannius. So I am thinking of
contriving some way of mentioning him appropriately—for that I think is
what you want—in one of the introductions. I am giving an introduction
to each book, as Aristotle does in the work he called the _Exoterics_.
And I only hope I may manage to get him in. For as you fully comprehend,
I have set my hand to a subject of wide range and of some difficulty,
which requires much leisure; and that is precisely what I have not got.

While praising those books, you miss the character of Scaevola from the
scene. It was not without good reason that I removed him. Our god Plato
did the same in his _Republic_. When Socrates called on that wealthy and
cheery old soul Cephalus in the Piraeus, the old man takes part in the
discussion during the introductory conversation; but after a very neat
speech, he pleads that he wants to go to a divine service, and does not
come back again. I fancy Plato thought it would have been inartistic to
keep a man of that age any longer in so lengthy a discussion. I thought
there was still more reason to be careful in the case of Scaevola, who
was at the age and in the state of health in which you must remember he
was, and was crowned with such honours that it would hardly have been
proper for him to spend several days with Crassus at his villa at
Tusculum. Besides, the talk in the first book was not unconnected with
Scaevola’s pursuits: while the remaining books contained a technical
discussion, as you know. In such I did not like the merry old man, you
remember, to take a part.

In Pilia’s business I will be sure to do what you suggest: for, as you
say, the point is quite clear on Aurelianus’ evidence. And it will give
me a chance of glorifying myself in my Tullia’s eyes. I am supporting
Vestorius: for I see you regard it as a favour, and I make him see it
too. But you know the kind of man he is: frightfully difficult to get on
with, even for two such easy-going people.

Now for your questions about C. Cato. You know he was acquitted under
the Junian and Licinian law. The Fufian law will acquit him too, I
assure you, and that as much to the relief of his accusers as of his
supporters. However, he has made his peace with Milo and myself. Drusus
is being prosecuted by Lucretius. The day for challenging the jury is
fixed for the 3rd of July. About Procilius there are sinister rumours:
but you know what juries are. Hirrus is on good terms with Domitius. The
decree which these consuls have carried about the provinces, “whosoever
henceforth,” etc., I do not think will have any effect.

I don’t know what to say to your question about Messalla: I have never
seen candidates more evenly matched. You know Messalla’s support.
Scaurus has been called into court by Triarius; without any great
sympathy for him being aroused, if you want to know. However his
aedileship recalls no unpleasant memories, and their remembrance of his
father has some weight with the country voters. The other two plebeian
candidates are about equal, as Domitius is strong in friends and his
very popular gladiatorial exhibition will count for him too, while
Memmius is popular with Caesar’s soldiers and relies on the support of
Pompey’s Gaul. If that does not avail him,

There, I have answered the letter Paccius brought. Now you must let me
scold you, if you deserve it. In the letter dated from Buthrotum which
was delivered by C. Decimius, you say you think you will have to go to
Asia. For the life of me I cannot see any reason why it should make the
least little bit of difference whether you act by proxy or in person;
nor why you should so often go to such out of the way places. But I wish
I had tackled you about it before you had taken any steps: then I should
certainly have had some influence. As it is, I will keep the rest of my
scolding for another time. I only hope it may prevail on you to return
quickly.

The reason why I write so seldom to you is that I do not know where you
are or are going to be. But as there was some one or other who thought
he might see you, I decided to give him this letter. Since you think of
going to Asia, let me know when we may expect you back and what you have
done about Eutychides.

secrets that we cannot even trust an amanuensis as a rule, for fear of
some jest leaking out.

The consuls’ infamy has had a lurid light thrown on it owing to C.
Memmius, one of the candidates, reading out in the Senate an agreement
made by himself and his fellow-candidate Domitius with them. If they
were elected to the consulship, they were both to give the consuls £350
each, if they did not produce three augurs who would depose that they
were present at the carrying of a _lex curiata_—which had never been
passed; and two ex-consuls who would depose to having been present at
the drafting of a decree for the fitting out of the consular
provinces—though there had never been any meeting of the Senate about it
at all. As this compact was alleged not to be a mere verbal compact, but
one properly drawn up with the sums promised on it, drafts on the bank,
and many other documents, Memmius exhibited it, with all the items
entered,[155] on the suggestion of Pompey. It was all the same to
Appius: he had nothing to lose by it. The other has had a sad comedown,
and I may say is quite done for. Memmius, however, having dissolved the
coalition against Calvinus’ will, has sunk out of mind, and his ruin is
all the more irretrievable because we know now that his disclosure
annoyed Caesar very much. Our friend Messalla and his fellow-competitor
Domitius were very liberal to the people, and could not be more popular.
They are certain of election. But the Senate has decreed that a trial
with closed doors should be held before the elections, and each
candidate’s conduct inquired into by the panels chosen by lot for all of
them. The candidates are in a great fright: but some of the jury—among

them Opimus, Veiento, and Rantius—have appealed to the tribunes to
prevent their being called upon to serve without the sanction of the
people. The affair is going on. A senatorial decree postponed the
elections until an enactment about the trial with closed doors was
carried. The day for that enactment came, and Terentius vetoed it. The
consuls, who were taking the matter very coolly, referred the point to
the Senate. Thereupon there was Bedlam, and I contributed my share of
noise. You will say: “Can you never hold your tongue?” Forgive me: I
hardly can. But could anything be more ridiculous? The Senate had passed
a decree that the elections should not be held before that enactment was
passed: if it was vetoed, then the matter should be brought forward
again. The law was brought forward casually; it was vetoed to the
satisfaction of the proposers; the matter was referred to the Senate:
and they decided that it was to the interest of the State that the
elections should be held as soon as possible.

Scaurus, who was acquitted in the last few days, after a most elaborate
speech from me in his defence, gave the requisite donations to the
people tribe by tribe at his own house, since all the days up to the
last of September, on which I am writing, had been rendered impossible
for the elections by ill omens announced by Scaevola. But though his
liberality exceeded theirs, those who came first won the most
popularity. I should like to see your face as you read this. For of
course you have no hope that the business will be protracted over many
weeks. But there is going to be a meeting of the Senate on the first of
October, to-day, for the day is already breaking. There no one will
speak boldly except Antius and

Favonius: Cato is ill. You need not be afraid for me, but I won’t

What else do you want to know? Oh! the trials, I suppose. Drusus and
Scaurus are thought to be innocent. Three candidates will probably be
prosecuted, Domitius by Memmius, Messalla by Q. Pompeius Rufus, Scaurus
by Triarius or L. Caesar. What shall I be able to find to say for them,
you will ask. May I die, if I know. Certainly I find no suggestions in
those three books you praise so highly.

Here is the other news. From my brother’s letters I hear that Caesar
shows signs of extraordinary affection for me, and this is confirmed by
a very cordial letter from Caesar himself. The result of the war in
Britain is looked forward to with anxiety. For it is proved that the
approach to the island is guarded with astonishing masses of rock, and
it has been ascertained too that there is not a scrap of silver in the
island, nor any hope of booty except from slaves; but I don’t fancy you
will find any with literary or musical talents among them.

Paulus has almost reached the roof of his colonnade in the Forum. He has
used the same old columns, but has executed most magnificently the part
he put out on contract. It goes without saying that a monument like that
will win for him more popularity and glory than anything. And so we
friends of Caesar—myself and Oppius I mean, though you may explode with
wrath at my confession—have thought nothing of spending half a million
of money[157] for that public work of which you used to speak so
enthusiastically, the extension of the Forum and continuation of it as
far as the Hall of Liberty. We could not

... So now, to give you my opinion on affairs, we have got to put up
with them. You want to know how I behaved. With firmness and boldness.
You will ask how Pompey took things. Quite kindly, evidently thinking he
must consider my dignity until satisfaction had been paid to me. How did
Gabinius come to be acquitted then? It was simply a puppet show: the
behaviour of the accusers—that is to say of L. Lentulus, the younger,
who is being universally accused of collusion—was incredibly infantile:
Pompey exerted his influence energetically: and the jury were a rotten
lot. Still 32 voted for condemnation and 38 for acquittal. Other trials
are hanging over his head: he is not out of the wood yet. You will say:
“How then do you take it?” Quite coolly, upon my word, and I
congratulate myself thereon. The State, my dear Pomponius, has lost not
only its sap and blood,

non modo sucum ac sanguinem, sed etiam colorem et speciem pristinam
civitatis. Nulla est res publica, quae delectet, in qua acquiescam.
“Idne igitur,” inquies; “facile fers?” Id ipsum; recorder enim, quam
bella paulisper nobis gubernantibus civitas fuerit, quae mihi gratia
relata sit. Nullus dolor me angit unum omnia posse; dirumpuntur ii, qui
me aliquid posse doluerunt. Multa mihi dant solacia, nec tamen ego de

et nihil obtinente

but even all its old colour and outward semblance. There is in fact no
Republic to give one a feeling of joy and peace. “And is that what you
find so comfortable?” you may ask. That is the very thing. For I
remember its glory during the little while when I directed it, and the
return that was paid me. It does not cost me a pang to see one man
omnipotent: but those who were annoyed at my small power are bursting
with indignation. There are many things which bring consolation to me
without my stirring from my original position; and I am returning to the
life which suits my nature best, to literature and my studies. For the
labour of pleading I console myself by my delight in oratory. I find
pleasure in my town house and my country houses. I think not of the
height from which I have fallen, but of the depths from which I have
risen. If I have but my brother and you with me, they may be hanged
drawn and quartered for all I care: I can study philosophy with you.
That part of my soul which used to harbour wrath has lost its power of
feeling. Now only my private and personal affairs interest me. You will
find me in a wonderfully peaceful state of mind, and upon my word your
return is a great factor in my peace: for there is no one in the world
whose spirit so harmonizes with my own.

But now I will tell you the other news. Things are drifting towards an
interregnum: and a dictatorship is in the air. There is a great deal of
talk about it, which helped Gabinius with timid jurors. All the
candidates for the consulship are accused of bribery. Gabinius is with
them too. P. Sulla applied for the prosecution of him, suspecting that
he would be too out of pocket to bribe a jury. Torquatus applied too

but did not obtain it. But they will all be acquitted, and in future no
one will be condemned except for homicide. That charge is being severely
dealt with and so informers are busy. M. Fulvius Nobilior has been
condemned: and a number of others are polite enough not even to answer
the charge.

Any other news? Yes. An hour after the acquittal of Gabinius another
jury in indignation condemned some one called Antiochus Gabinius, out of
Sopolis’ studio, a freedman and attendant of Gabinius, under the Papian
law. He at once said “So the State will not acquit me of treason as it
did you.”[159]

Pomptinus wants to celebrate his triumph on the 2nd of November. He is
openly opposed by the praetors Cato and Servilius and the tribune Q.
Mucius, who declare that no authority was ever given for a triumph: and
it certainly was given in the most absurd manner. However Pomptinus will
have the consul Appius on his side. Cato declares he shall never triumph
as long as he lives. I fancy it will all come to nothing like most
similar affairs. Appius is thinking of going to Cilicia without
authority and at his own expense.

On the 24th of October I received a letter from my brother Quintus and
from Caesar, dated from the nearest point on the coast of Britain on the
25th of September. Britain is settled, hostages taken, no booty, but a
tribute imposed; and they are bringing back the army from the place. Q.

nothing to keep you there. You surely wont throw days away on Vestorius
and have another taste of his Latin Greek after all this interval. Fly
hither rather, and visit the remains of what was once our genuine
Republic. I have discussed the open bribery of the people tribe by tribe
before the elections, and the consequent acquittal of Gabinius. Things
are tending to a dictatorship, what with the deadlock and the general

to give you something to look forward to. My best respects to Dionysius.

new decrees are passed, to prevent this painful separation from lasting
more than one year. You have taken the right steps with Annius
Saturninus. As to the guarantee, please give it yourself, while you are
in town. There are some proofs of ownership, for instance those for
Mennius’ or rather Atilius’ estate. You have done exactly what I wanted
in Oppius’ case, especially in putting the £7,000[165] to his credit. I
must have that paid off without waiting till I’ve got in all my arrears,
even if I have to get into the hands of the Jews[166] over it.

Now I come to the line you wrote crosswise at the end of your letter, in
which you give me a word of advice about your sister. The facts of the
case are that when I reached Arpinum and my brother had come, the first
thing we did was to have a long talk about you. After that I brought the
talk round to the discussion you and I had about your sister at
Tusculum. My brother’s behaviour then to your sister was gentleness and
kindness itself. If there ever was any quarrel about

Postridie ex Arpinati profecti sumus. Ut in Arcano Quintus maneret, dies
fecit, ego Aquini, sed prandimus in Arcano. Nosti hunc fundum. Quo ut
venimus, humanissime Quintus “Pomponia” inquit, “tu invita mulieres, ego
arcivero viros.” Nihil potuit, mihi quidem ut visum est, dulcius idque
cum verbis tum etiam animo ac vultu. At illa audientibus nobis “Ego ipsa
sum” inquit “hic hospita,” id autem ex eo, ut opinor, quod antecesserat
Statius, ut prandium nobis videret. Tum Quintus “En” inquit mihi “haec
ego patior cotidie.” Dices: “Quid, quaeso, istuc erat?” Magnum; itaque
me ipsum commoverat; sic absurde et aspere verbis vultuque responderat.
Dissimulavi dolens. Discubuimus omnes praeter illam, cui tamen Quintus
de mensa misit. Illa reiecit. Quid multa? nihil meo fratre lenius, nihil
asperius tua sorore mihi visum est; et multa praetereo, quae tum mihi
maiori stomacho quam ipsi Quinto fuerunt. Ego inde Aquinum. Quintus in
Arcano remansit et Aquinum ad me postridie mane venit mihique narravit
nee secum illam dormire voluisse et, cum discessura esset, fuisse eius
modi, qualem ego vidissem. Quid quaeris? vel ipsi hoc dicas licet,

expense, there were no signs of it. So passed that day. On the next day
we started from Arpinum. A festival caused Quintus to stop at Arcanum,
while I went on to Aquinum: but we lunched together at Arcanum. You know
his place there. Well, when we reached it, Quintus said most politely,
“Pomponia, you invite the ladies, I will ask the men.” Nothing, so far
as I could see, could have been more gentle than his words or his
intention or his expression. But before us all she answered “I’m only a
stranger here”; just because Statius had been sent on in front to get
dinner ready for us, I suppose. Says Quintus to me: “There you are.
That’s what I have to put up with every day.” You may say there surely
was not much in that. But there was a good deal: indeed she upset me
myself; she answered with such uncalled for acrimony in word and look. I
concealed my annoyance. We all took our places except her: but Quintus
sent her something from the table, which she refused. In a word, it
seemed to me that my brother was as good-tempered and your sister as
cross as could be, and I have omitted a lot of things that aroused my
wrath more than Quintus’. Then I went on to Aquinum. Quintus stayed at
Arcanum, and came to me the next morning, and told me that she would not
sleep with him and, when she was leaving, she was as cross as when I saw
her. In fact, I don’t care if you tell her herself, that to my mind she
behaved with a lack of courtesy that day.

I have said perhaps more than necessary about it to show you that it is
your turn to do a little instructing and advising too. It only remains
for you to fulfil all my commissions before you start, and send me an
account of all of them, to rout Pomptinus out,

On the 10th of May, the date of this letter, I set out from my villa at
Pompeii, to spend the day with Pontius in his villa at Trebula.
Thereafter I mean to do my day’s journey regularly without delay. While
I was in my villa at Cumae, our friend Hortensius paid me a very welcome
visit. He asked if I had any commissions, and I gave him commissions in
general, and in particular to prevent to the best of his ability
extension of my term of office in my province. Please keep him up to it,
and tell him that I was much gratified at his visit, and at his promises
on that particular point and of any other assistance I might need. I
have bound our friend Furnius, who, I see, will be tribune next year, to
help me in the same matter. My villa at Cumae was a miniature Rome;
there were such a lot of people in the neighbourhood. In the middle of
it all our friend Rufio, seeing that Vestorius was on his tracks,
baffled the man by a ruse; for he did not come to me. You may be
surprised that he did not come, seeing that Hortensius came, who is ill,
lives afar off and is a great man, and crowds of other people came as
well. I repeat he did not come. You may infer I did not see him. How
could I fail to see him when I travelled

opinion of the Senate on his case, and there was a report too that the
Transpadani were ordered to create a board of four municipal
officers.[167] If that is the case, I fear great disturbance: but I
shall learn some news from Pompey.

I reached Beneventum on the 11th of May. There I received the note which
you said in your last letter had been despatched. I answered that letter
on the day I received it from Pontius’ villa at Trebula. And indeed two
letters of yours reached me at Beneventum, one of them handed to me by
Funisulanus in the early morning, and the other by my secretary Tullius.
I am very grateful to you for your trouble about my first and most
important commission. But your departure from Rome lessens my

diligenter. Igitur, senatus consultum si erit factum, scribes ad me; si
minus, rem tamen conficies; mihi enim attribui oportebit, item Bibulo.
Sed non dubito, quin senatus consultum expeditum sit, in quo praesertim
sit compendium populi. De Torquato probe. De Masone et Ligure, cum
venerint. De illo, quod Chaerippus (quoniam hic quoque πρόσνευσιν

hope. As regards the man you mention, I am slipping into your view, not
that——but for want of a better we are compelled to be satisfied with
him. As for the other man who, you say, appears a not unlikely
candidate, I fear my daughter could not be persuaded, and, as you add,
there is not a pin to choose between them. For myself I am reasonable;
but you will be away, and will any account be taken of me in my absence?
For, if either of us were on the spot, a good face might be put on the
matter with Servius through the agency of Servilia. Now, even if it were
a thing I favoured, I see no way of bringing it to pass.

Now I come to that letter which I received from Tullius. You have been
very energetic about Marcellus: so, if a decree should be passed, please
inform me: but, if not, try to carry the matter through: a grant ought
to be made to me and to Bibulus. But I am confident that the decree will
be passed especially as it saves the people’s pocket. That is fine about
Torquatus. As for Maso and Ligur, we can wait till they come. As to
Chaerippus’ request, since you have given me no tip on the matter——hang
the province! Must I trouble about him too? Well, I must take enough
trouble to prevent any debate on the matter or count out in the House.
As for others——however you do well to have spoken with Scrofa. As to
Pomptinus you are right. It comes to this, if Pomptinus will be at
Brundisium before June, M. Anneius and L. Tullius need not hurry out of
Rome. As to your news from Sicinius, I am satisfied, provided this
restriction does not apply to anyone who has obliged me. But I will
think it over, as the plan pleases me. I will let you know

the following. I have received a letter from Rome, saying that my friend
Milo writes complaining of ill-treatment from me, for allowing
Philotimus to have a hand in the purchase of his property. I acted on
the advice of C. Duronius, a man whom I saw to be most friendly to Milo,
and just such a person as you suppose him to be. His plan and mine was
this, firstly, to keep a hold over Milo’s property for fear some hard
bargainer, a stranger to us, should rob him of his slaves, of whom a
great number were with him; and secondly, that the settlement he
intended to make on Fausta should be respected. There was the further
intention, that we ourselves should have the readiest means of saving
anything that could be saved. Now please review the whole matter, for
letters to me often exaggerate. If Milo complains and writes to his
friends, and, if Fausta wishes, as I told Philotimus and as he agreed, I
would not have him purchase the property against Milo’s wish. Nothing
would compensate for offending Milo. You will judge if the matter has
been exaggerated. Please consult Duronius. I have written also to
Camillus and to Lamia, among other reasons because I do not feel sure
you are in town. To sum up, in deciding be careful of my honour,
reputation and interests.

I came to Athens on the 25th of June, and I have waited three days for
Pomptinus, but have heard nothing certain of his coming. Believe me, you
are with me all the time, and, though it did not need associations to
turn my thoughts towards you, still I was reminded of you more than ever
by treading in your footsteps. Indeed we talk of nothing else but you;
but perhaps you prefer to have news about myself. So far no public body
or private person has spent money on me or on my staff. I have not even
taken the barest necessities allowed by the law of Julius, nor have I
billeted myself on anyone. My staff have made up their minds that they
must uphold my good name. So far everything has gone well: the Greeks
have noted it and are full of outspoken praise. For the rest I am
endeavouring to act as I know you would like. But let us reserve our
praise for the end of the story. In other respects I often blame my
mistake in not having found some method of escape from this flood of
affairs. The business is little suited to my tastes. It is a true
saying, “Cobbler, stick to your last.”[175] You will say: “What,
already? You have not yet begun your work.” Too true, and I fear worse
is to come. I put up with things with cheerful brow and smiling face;
but I suffer in my heart of hearts. There is so much ill temper and
insolence, such stupid folly of every kind, such arrogant talk and such
sullen silence to be put up with every day. I pass over this, not
because I wish to conceal it, but

friend and mine to Quintus. Still we are close neighbours and meet every
day. Please write me as soon as possible of your plans, and tell me what
you are doing, where you are from time to time, and especially when you
will be in town.

the term of my office

Non dici potest, quam flagrem desiderio urbis, quam vix harum rerum

Marcellus foede in Comensi. Etsi ille magistratum non gesserat, erat
tamen Transpadanus. Ita mihi videtur non minus stomachi nostro quam
Caesari fecisse. Sed hoc ipse viderit. Pompeius mihi quoque videbatur,
quod scribis Varronem dicere, in Hispaniam certe iturus. Id ego minime
probabam; qui quidem Theophani facile persuasi nihil esse melius quam
illum nusquam discedere. Ergo Graecus incumbet. Valet autem auctoritas
eius apud illum plurimum.

being extended. I cannot describe how ardently I long for town, how hard
I find it to bear the stupidity of life here.

Marcellus acted disgracefully over the man from Comum:[177] even if he
had not been a magistrate, still he was a Transpadane. So Marcellus’
action seems to me as likely to anger Pompey as Caesar; but that is his
own look-out. I agree with Varro’s statement, which you quote in your
letter, that Pompey will surely go to Spain. I by no means approve of
the policy, and indeed I convinced Theophanes easily that Pompey’s
presence in Rome was the very best course. So the Greek will put
pressure on Pompey; and his opinion weighs with him a great deal.

I despatch this letter on the 6th of July, being about to leave Athens,
where I have stayed just ten days. Pomptinus has come along with Cn.
Volusius. My quaestor is here. Your friend Tullius is the one absentee.
I have some open boats of Rhodes and two-deckers from Mitylene and a few
despatch boats. There is no news of the Parthians. For the rest, God
help us.

So far our journey through Greece has provoked great admiration, and I
have no fault at all to find with my staff at present. They seem to
understand what my case is, and the terms on which they stand. They do
everything to maintain my good name. For the rest, if the saying be
true, “Like master, like man,”[178] assuredly they will stick to their
good behaviour,

fecerant, commodius visum est et Xenoni et post ipsi Patroni me ad
Memmium scribere, qui pridie, quam ego Athenas veni, Mitilenas profectus
erat, ut is ad suos scriberet posse id sua voluntate fieri. Non enim
dubitabat Xeno, quin ab Ariopagitis invito Memmio impetrari non posset.

for they will see no excuse for misconduct in any act of mine. If
example be futile, I must try severer means. So far I have been mild and
kind, and I hope I am making headway. But I have looked forward to
playing patience, as the Sicilians say, for one year only. So fight for
me, for fear extension of office might spoil my conduct.

To return to the commissions you have given me. Prefects have exemption
from serving on a jury. Give the office to whom you will. I shall not be
so _difficile_, as I was in the case of Appuleius. I am as fond of Xeno
as you are, and I am sure he knows it. I have put you in well-deserved
favour with Patro and the other blockheads. Ister has told me you have
written to him that you learned from Patro’s letter I was taking an
interest in the point, much to his delight. But when Patro urged me to
ask your Areopagus to cancel the minute they had made when Polycharmus
was praetor, it seemed better to Xeno and afterwards to Patro himself
that I should send a letter to Memmius, who had set out to Mitylenae the
day before I arrived at Athens, asking him to inform his agents that the
minute could be cancelled with his free consent. For Xeno was sure the
Areopagus would refuse to act against his will. Memmius had abandoned
his plan of building a house; but he was angry with Patro. I enclose a
copy of the careful letter I wrote him.

Please convey my condolences to Pilia. I will tell you a secret you are
not to repeat to her: I received the parcel containing her letter, took
it out, opened and read it. It was written in terms of sympathy for
Quintus. Please consider the letters you got from Brundisium without one

A sea voyage is a big business, especially in the month of July. Six
days after leaving Athens I came to Delos. On the 6th of July I got from
the Piraeus to Zoster with a contrary wind which kept us there on the
7th. On the 8th we reached Ceos in fine weather. From there we came to
Gyaros, with a wind strong, but not contrary: thence to Syros, and from
Syros to Delos; in both cases sailing quicker than we could have wished.
You know by this time what the open boats of Rhodes are like, poor
things in a rough sea. So I have made up my mind not to hurry and not to
stir from Delos until I see “all the peaks of Gyrae” clear.

I sent you a letter about Messalla at once from Gyaros as soon as I
heard, and another on my own initiative to Hortensius, for I felt much

be as kind as you always are, if anything can be done. To the last item,

I reached Ephesus on the 22nd of July, the five hundred and sixtieth day
after the battle of Bovillae.[180] The voyage caused me no alarm and no
sickness, but was slow owing to the crankiness of the open boats. I
imagine you have heard about the crowd of legations and of private
suitors and about the astonishing number of people who met me even at
Samos, and even more noticeably at Ephesus; or you may say it does not
interest you. Still the tax-collectors thrust themselves on my notice as
though I had come with an army behind me, and the Greeks as if I were
governor of Asia. You will see that the professions of my life are now
being put to the test. I hope I shall employ the training I have learned
from you and satisfy everybody, the more easily because in my province
the contracts have been settled. But

I attended to your little jobs at Ephesus and although before my arrival

the Parthians are at peace; secondly that the contracts with the

mutiny of his soldiers and paid them up to the 15th of July.

Asia has given me an astonishing welcome. My coming has cost no one a

You would never believe how sick I am of the business and I cannot find
sufficient scope for the wide interests and energy you know I possess,
and do nothing noticeable. To think that I hold court in Laodicea, while
A. Plotius does so at Rome, and that I have the nominal command of two
skeleton legions, while Caesar has a huge army! However, it is not these
advantages I miss: it is the world, the Forum, the city, my home and
you. I will bear as best I can a year of office: an extension would kill
me. Still we may combat that very easily if only you are at Rome.

You ask what I am doing. Upon my life I am spending a fortune. I am
marvellously pleased with the rule of conduct I have formed: and you
have taught me to be so admirably self restrained that I fear I may have
to borrow to pay off the money I took from you. I avoid opening the
wounds which Appius has inflicted on the province: but they are patent
and cannot be hidden. I travel from Laodicea on the 3rd of August, the
date of this letter, to the camp in Lycaonia. Thence I intend to go to
Taurus, so that I may settle the matter of your slave, if possible, by
pitched battle with Moeragenes.

so, as I wrote before, give me news of political matters as well as
other things. I will write more fully. [This letter I know] will be a

Though the tax-farmers’ messengers are actually on their road and I am
travelling, still I think I must snatch a moment for fear you may
imagine I have forgotten your commission. So I sit down on the high road
to scribble you a summary of what really calls for a long epistle. You
must know that my arrival in this province, which is in a state of
lasting ruin and desolation, was expected eagerly. I got here on the
31st of July. I stayed three days at Laodicea, three at Apamea, and as
many at Synnas.[183] Everywhere I heard the same tale. People could not
pay the poll-tax: they were forced to sell out their investments: groans
and lamentations in the towns, and awful conduct of one who is some kind
of savage beast rather than a man. All the people are, as you may
suppose, tired of life. However, the poor towns are relieved that they
have had to spend nothing on me, my legates, or a quaestor, or anyone.
For you must know that I not only refused to accept pay, or what is a
proper perquisite under the Julian law, but that none of us will take
firewood or anything beyond four beds and a roof; and in many places we
do not accept even a roof, but remain mostly under canvas. So

in the town of Antioch with his whole army. I am in Cappadocia near the
Taurus with my army close to Cybistra. The enemy is in Cyrrhestica, a
district of Syria adjoining my province. I have sent a despatch to the
Senate on the situation. If you are in Rome, please look at the despatch
and say whether you think it ought to be delivered: and so for my other
affairs, chief of which is lest there be, as the saying goes, any slip
between the cup and the lip,[184] I mean that I may not be burdened with
an extension of office. Considering the weakness of my army, my want of
allies, especially faithful allies, my most sure support is the winter
weather. If winter comes and the enemy have not first crossed into my
province, I am afraid the Senate may refuse to let Pompey leave Rome
owing to fear of disturbance at home. But if it sends some one else by
spring, I don’t care, provided that there be no extension of my term of
office. Those are my commissions, if you are in town. If you are out of
town, or even if you are not, the situation is this. I am in excellent
spirits; and I hope, as my plans are well laid, that I am not too
sanguine about my preparations. I have pitched camp in a safe spot, well
supplied on the score of corn, almost within sight of Cilicia,
convenient for change of quarters, with an army small but, I hope, very
loyal to me, which will be doubled by the arrival of Deiotarus with all
his forces. I have found our allies far more loyal than any of my
predecessors have found them. They cannot understand my mildness and

You are always in my mind’s eye. and I understand your affectionate
sympathy as if you were standing here. But I beseech you, if it can be
arranged and supposing that my case is not debated in the House up to
the first of January, to be in Rome during that month. I shall be
treated fairly, if you are there. The consuls are my friends; Furnius
the tribune of the people is devoted to me: but I want you with your
ingratiating and skilful persistence. It is a critical time. But it
would be a shame for me to press you further.

My son and nephew are staying with Deiotarus. If necessary, they shall
be sent to Rhodes. If you are in Rome, send me a message with your usual
regularity. And even if you are in Epirus, send me one of your
messengers, that you may know my proceedings, and I may know your
present and future plans. I am managing your friend Brutus’ business
better than he could himself. But I now hand my ward[185] over to the
creditors and refuse to set up any plea for him. They are an
impracticable and impecunious lot. However I shall satisfy you, which is
more difficult even than satisfying Brutus. Indeed I will satisfy you
both.

On the morning of the 17th of December the Pindenissitae surrendered to
me, on the fifty-seventh day from the commencement of my siege. “The
Pindenissitae!” you will exclaim, “Who the deuce are they? I never heard
the name.” That is not my fault. Could I turn Cilicia into Aetolia or
Macedonia? Take this for granted that with my army and in my position
such a big business was impossible. Here is a synopsis of the affair.
You agreed to that in your last letter. You are aware of my arrival at
Ephesus, for you have congratulated me on the reception I got on the day
of arrival, which delighted me beyond words. Thence, after a marvellous
welcome in the towns on my way, I reached Laodicea on the 31st of July.
I stayed there two days in great state and with nattering speeches took
the sting out of all past injuries. I did the same at Colossae and
during a stay of five days at Apamea, three at Synnada, five at
Philomelus and ten at Iconium. Nothing could be more fair, lenient or
dignified than my legal decisions. From there I came to camp on the 24th
of August. On the 28th I reviewed the army at Iconium. On receipt of
grave news about the Parthians I left camp for Cilicia travelling
through that part of Cappadocia which borders on Cilicia, intending that
the Armenian Artavasdes and the Parthians themselves should realize they
were cut off from entering Cappadocia. After camping five

Cappadocia se excludi putarent. Cum dies quinque ad Cybistra Cappadociae
castra habuissem, certior sum factus Parthos ab illo aditu Cappadociae
longe abesse, Ciliciae magis imminere. Itaque confestim iter in Ciliciam
feci per Tauri pylas. Tarsum veni a. d. III Nonas Octobres. Inde ad
Amanum contendi, qui Syriam a Cilicia in aquarum divertio dividit; qui
mons erat hostium plenus sempiternorum. Hic a. d. III Idus Octobr.
magnum numerum hostium occidimus. Castella munitissiina nocturno
Pomptini adventu, nostro matutino cepimus, incendimus. Imperatores
appellati sumus. Castra paucos dies habuimus ea ipsa, quae contra Darium
habuerat apud Issum Alexander, imperator haud paulo melior quam aut tu
aut ego. Ibi dies quinque morati direpto et vastato Amano inde
discessimus. Interim (scis enim dici quaedam πανικά, dici item τὰ κενὰ

oppido Cassius insecutus rem bene gessit. Qua in fuga magna auctoritate
Osaces dux Parthorum vulnus accepit eoque interiit paucis post diebus.
Erat in Syria nostrum nomen in gratia. Venit interim Bibulus; credo,
voluit appellatione hac inani nobis esse par. In eodem Amano coepit
loreolam in mustaceo quaerere. At ille cohortem primam totam perdidit
centurionemque primi pili, nobilem sui generis, Asinium

days at Cybistra in Cappadocia, I got information that the Parthians
were far distant from that entrance into Cappadocia, and rather were
threatening Cilicia. So I made a forced march into Cilicia by the gates
of Taurus. I reached Tarsus on the 5th of October. Thence I hurried to
Amanus, which divides Syria from Cilicia by its watershed, a mountain
that has always been full of our enemies. Here on the 13th of October we
cut up a large body of the enemy. I captured some strongly fortified
posts by a night assault of Pomptinus and a day assault of my own: and
we burned them. I was hailed as “General.” For a few days I pitched camp
at the very spot near Issus, where Alexander had camped against Darius.
He was rather a better general than you or I. We plundered and
devastated Amanus, and after a stay of five days took our departure.
Meantime (for you know there are such words as “panic” and “the
uncertainties of war”) report of my arrival gave heart to Cassius, who
was shut up in Antioch, and it inspired fear in the Parthians. So, as
the Parthians retreated from the town, Cassius pursued them and scored a
success. In their retreat one of their leaders, Osaces, a man of high
rank, was wounded and died a few days afterwards. I was in high favour
in Syria. Meantime Bibulus came. I fancy he wanted to be my peer in the
matter of that empty title. On this same mountain Amanus he begins his
task of looking for a needle in a bottle of hay.[188] But the whole of
his first squadron was lost as well as Asinius Dento, a centurion of the
first line and of noble

tribune. Sex. Lucilius son of T. Gavius Caepio, who has wealth and
position. It was really a mortifying reverse and inopportune. I was at
Pindenissus, the most strongly fortified town in Eleutherocilicia and
engaged in war so long as men can remember. The inhabitants were keen
warriors, thoroughly prepared to withstand a siege. We compassed it with
a stockade and ditch, with big entrenchments, penthouses, a tall tower,
a large supply of artillery and a number of archers. With much toil and
preparation I settled the business without loss of life, though many
were wounded. I am keeping a festive holiday, as also are my soldiers,
to whom I gave all the spoils except the horses. The captives were sold
on the third day of the festival of Saturn.[190] At the time of writing,
the sum realized at the auction has reached about £100,000.[191] I am
giving my army to my brother Quintus to take into winter quarters in the
more disturbed part of the province, while I am returning myself to
Laodicea.

timerem.

connoting resistance of pleasure: for nothing in my life has given me
more pleasure than this rectitude. And it is not so much the enhancement
of my reputation, though that is important, as the exercise of the
virtue that delights me. I can tell you my exile has been worth while,
for I did not understand myself nor realize of what I was capable in
this line. I may well be puffed up. It is splendid. Meantime I have made
a _coup_ in this: it is thanks to me that Ariobarzanes lives and reigns
a king. In my progress through the province I have saved a king and a
kingdom by the weight of my advice and official position and by refusing
to entertain even the visits much less the bribes of conspirators
against him. Meantime from Cappadocia not the value of a hair. I stirred
up Brutus out of his dejection as much as I could. I love him as well as
you do. I had almost said as well as I do you. And I hope that during
the whole of my year of office there will not be a penny’s expense in my
province.

That is the whole story. I am now preparing to send an official despatch
to Rome. It will be richer in detail than if I had sent it from Amanus.
But fancy your not being in town! Everything hangs on what happens on
the 1st of March, for I fear, when the question of the provinces is
under debate, that I may be kept here, if Caesar refuses to give up his
province. Were you there to take part in the matter, I should have no
fears.

work-a-day life, but of your holiday life. Nicanor is doing his duty by
me, and is being well treated. I think I shall send him to Rome with my

time that he may bring me certain news about you and from you. I am
pleased that Alexis so often sends greetings to me; but why cannot he
put them in a letter of his own, as Tiro, who is my Alexis, does for
you. I am searching for a horn for Phemius.[194] But enough now. Keep

I am very glad that you have reached Epirus safely, and that you report
a voyage to your liking. But I am rather upset that you are absent from
Rome at a moment so critical for me. However I have one consolation: I
hope you will have a pleasant winter where you are and a nice rest. You
ask me the purport of a letter that C. Cassius, the brother of Q.
Cassius, your friend, sent me. The letter he wrote is more modest than a
subsequent epistle in which he claimed to have ended the Parthian war.
The Parthians to be sure had retired from Antioch before the arrival of
Bibulus: but it was not thanks to any _coup de main_ of our troops.
To-day the enemy is wintering in Cyrrhestica and a serious war is
imminent: for the son of Orodes the king of the Parthians is in a Roman
province, and Deiotarus, to whose son the daughter of Artavasdes is
betrothed, a very competent authority, is positive that the king himself
will cross the Euphrates with all his forces in the early summer. On the
very day on which Cassius’ despatch, dated the 7th of October,
announcing victory was read in the Senate, came mine announcing trouble.
My friend Axius says that Cassius’ despatch gained no belief and mine
was considered worthy of attention. Bibulus’ despatch had not yet
arrived: but I know for a fact that it will express alarm.

Ex his rebus hoc vereor, ne, cum Pompeius propter metum rerum novarum
nusquam dimittatur, Caesari nullus honos a senatu habeatur, dum hic
nodus expediatur, non putet senatus nos, antequam successum sit,
oportere decedere nec in tanto motu rerum tantis provinciis singulos
legates praeesse. Hic, ne quid mihi prorogetur, quod ne intercessor
quidem sustinere possit, horreo, atque eo magis, quod tu abes, qui
consilio, gratia, studio multis rebus occurreres. Sed dices me ipsum
mihi sollicitudinem struere. Cogor, ut velim ita sit; sed omnia metuo.
Etsi bellum ἀκροτελεύτιον habet illa tua epistula, quam dedisti nauseans

This makes me fear that the Senate may pay no respect to Caesar’s
demands, refusing to let Pompey quit Rome, when revolution is imminent.
Until this trouble is unravelled, it may decline to allow me to leave
the province before my successor comes, and not be willing to entrust
such important provinces in troublous times to legates. So I shudder to
think that the term of my office may be extended without even any
tribune being able to veto it; and the more so on account of your
absence, when you might interfere in many cases with your advice,
influence and efforts. You will say I am raising imaginary alarms. I am
forced to hope that my alarms may be idle, but everything frightens me.
Though your letter written at Buthrotum in sickness had a charming
_finale_. “As I see and hope, there will be nothing to hinder your
departure,” still I should prefer the phrase “as I see” and there was no
need for the words “and hope.” I have received a letter dated just after
the triumph of Lentulus, which was brought post haste to Iconium by the
tax-farmers’ messengers. In it you repeat that bitter-sweet saying, that
there will be no delay, with a postscript, that, if anything goes wrong,
you yourself will come to me. I am tortured by the doubts you express:
and you may see which of your letters I have received, for I have not
got the letter which you say was handed to Hermo the centurion’s
orderly. You have repeatedly told me you entrusted a letter to the
slaves of Laenius. That letter, which was dated the 21st of September,
was handed to me at last by Laenius on my arrival at Laodicea on the
11th of February. I will show Laenius at once in word and in the future
in deed that your recommendation carries weight. Besides old topics the
letter had

one fresh one, the panthers from Cibyra. I am indebted to you for
telling M. Octavius that you thought it would be impracticable. But in
future give a direct “no” to any undesirable requests. Firm fixed in my
own determination and fired by the weight of your opinion, I have
overcome everybody as you will find by my justice, self-abnegation and
easy courtesy. People were never more astonished than to learn that not
a farthing has been spent during my tenure of office, either on public
objects or on any of my staff, except on my legate L. Tullius. He has
behaved well on the whole, but under the Julian law on one occasion _en
passage_ and for the day’s needs, and not as others would at every
hamlet, he did take something. He is the sole offender; and forces me to
add a rider to my remark that not a farthing has been spent upon us.
Besides him no one has taken a penny. That blot I owe to my friend Q.
Titinius.

When the camp was struck at the end of the summer, I put my brother
Quintus in charge of the winter camp and of Cilicia. Q. Volusius,
son-in-law of your friend Tiberius, a safe man and wonderfully
unselfish, I have sent to Cyprus, ordering him to stay a few days, that
the few Roman citizens in business there may not say they have no
facilities for legal process: the inhabitants cannot be summoned to a
court outside the island. I myself set out for Asia from Tarsus on the
fifth of January. I cannot describe how the cities in Cilicia and
especially the people of Tarsus looked up to me. After crossing the
Taurus, I found Asia, that is so far as my district extends, very keen
to welcome me. For during the six months of my administration, there had
been no requisitions and

not a single case of billeting. Before my time this season had been
devoted every year to the pursuit of gain. The richer states used to pay
large sums to escape from having soldiers billeted on them for the
winter. The people of Cyprus used to pay nearly £50,000,[196] while
under my administration, in literal truth, not a penny will be demanded.
I will take no honours except speechifying in return for these
kindnesses which have so amazed people. I allow neither statues, nor
shrines, nor sculptured chariots: and I don’t annoy the states in any
other respects—but perhaps I may annoy you by my egotism. Bear with it
from your regard for me. It was you who wished me to act as I have. My
tour through Asia was such that even the crowning misery of famine,
which existed in my province owing to the failure of the crops, gave me
a welcome opportunity. Wherever I went, without force, without legal
process, without hard words, by my personal influence and exhortations,
I induced Greeks and Roman citizens, who had stored corn, to promise a
large quantity to the communities. On the 13th of February, the date on
which I despatch this letter, I have arranged to try cases from Cibyra
and Apamea at Laodicea; from the 15th of March, from Synnada, Pamphylia
(when I will look out for a horn for Phemius), Lycaonia and Isaurum at
the same place. After the 15th of May, I set out to spend June in
Cilicia: I hope without being troubled by the Parthians. July, if things
turn out as I hope, is to be spent on my journey back through the
province. I entered the province at Laodicea during the consulship of
Sulpicius and Marcellus on the 31st of

July. I ought to quit it on the 30th of July. First, however, I must ask
my brother Quintus to be good enough to take charge, which will be
against the grain with us both. But it will be the only fair course,
especially since even now I cannot keep that excellent fellow Pomptinus;
for Postumius is dragging him back to town, and perhaps Mrs Postumius
too.

Those are my plans. Now let me tell you about Brutus. Among his
intimates your friend Brutus has some creditors of the people of Salamis
in Cyprus, M. Scaptius and P. Matinius, whom he recommended to me
warmly. Matinius I have not met: Scaptius came to see me in camp. For
the sake of Brutus I promised that the people of Salamis should settle
their debts to him. The fellow thanked me, and asked for the post of
prefect. I informed him I always refused business men, as I have told
you. This rule Cn. Pompeius accepted when he made a similar request. So
did Torquatus, M. Laenius, and many others. However, I told Scaptius
that if he wanted the post on account of his bond, I would see that he
got paid. He thanked me and took his leave. Our friend Appius had given
him some squadrons to put pressure on the people of Salamis, and had
also given him the office of prefect. He was causing trouble to the
people of Salamis. I gave orders that his cavalry should leave the
island. That annoyed him. In short, to keep faith with him, I ordered
the people, when they came along with Scaptius to see me at Tarsus, to
pay the money. They had a good deal to say about the bond, and about the
harm that Scaptius had done them. I refused to listen. I prayed and
besought them to

nomine quam in vectigali praetorio. Collaudavi homines. “Recte,” inquit
Scaptius, “sed subducamus summam.” Interim, cum ego in edicto

settle the business in consideration of the good that I had done their
state. Finally, I threatened to compel them. So far from refusing to
settle, the people said that really they would be paying out of my
pocket, in the sense that I had refused to take the present usually
given to the governor, which they admitted would be more than the amount
they owed to Scaptius. I praised their attitude. “Very well,” said
Scaptius; “but let us reckon up the total.” Now in my traditionary
edict[197] I had fixed the rate of interest at 12 per cent compound
interest, reckoned by the year. But Scaptius demanded 48 per cent in
accordance with the terms of the bond. I declared that I could not break
the rule laid down in my edict. But he produced a decree of the Senate,
made in the consulship of Lentulus and Philippus,[198] ordering that the
governor of Cilicia should give judgement according to the bond. At
first I was horror stricken, for it spelled ruin to the community. I
find there are two decrees of the Senate in the same year about this
identical bond. When the people of Salamis wanted to raise a loan in
town to pay off another, they were obstructed by a law of Gabinius which
forbade lending to provincials. Then these intimates of Brutus,
depending on his support, professed willingness to lend at 48 per cent,
if they were protected by a decree of the Senate. Brutus induced the
Senate to make a decree that the transaction between the people of
Salamis and the money-lenders should be exempted from the provisions of
the law. They paid down the money. Afterwards it came into the heads of
the

velle accipere. Debere autem illos paulo minus. Rogat, ut eos ad ducenta

non bono quaternas centesimas sperabat.

money-lenders that the decree would be futile, because Gabinius’ law
forbade any legal process on the bond. Then the Senate passed a decree
that the bond should be good at law, giving this bond the same validity
as other bonds and nothing more. When I pointed this out, Scaptius took
me aside. He said that he had no objection to my ruling; but that the
people of Salamis imagined they owed him nearly £50,000. That he wanted
to get that sum, but that they owed rather less. He begged me to induce
them to fix it at that amount. “Very well,” said I. I sent Scaptius
away, and summoned the people and asked them the amount of the debt.
They replied something over £25,000. I consulted Scaptius again. He was
loud in his protests. I said that the only plan was for them to check
their accounts. They sat down and made out the account. It agreed to a
penny with their statement. They wanted to pay, and begged him to
receive the money. Again Scaptius led me aside, and asked me to let the
matter stand over. The request was impertinent, but I consented. I would
not listen to the complaints of the Greeks and their demand to deposit
the sum in the temple treasury. The bystanders all declared that the
conduct of Scaptius was outrageous in refusing 12 per cent with compound
interest. Others said he was a fool. He seemed to me to be more of a
knave than a fool: for either he was not content with 12 per cent on
good security, or he hoped for 48 per cent on very doubtful security.

There is my case. If Brutus does not approve, there is no reason why I
should be friendly with him. Certainly his uncle will approve,
especially since a decree of the Senate has been passed (after you left

Rome, I think) in the matter of money-lenders, that 12 per cent simple
interest shall be the rate. The difference between the two totals you
will already have arrived at, if I do not belie your skill as a
ready-reckoner. _Apropos_ of this, by the way, L. Lucceius, son of
Marcus, writes me a petulant letter that there is great danger of a
general repudiation of debts resulting from these decrees. He recalls
the harm that C. Julius did once when he allowed a little postponement
of the day of payment: public credit never received a worse blow. But to
return to my point. Think over my case against Brutus, if it is a case,
when there are no fair arguments on the other side, especially as I have
left the matter as it stood.

To wind up with family matters. As to my _boudoir_ business, I agree
with you in preferring Postumia’s son,[201] since Pontidia is playing
the fool. But I wish you were there. You must expect no letters from
Quintus at this season. The snows prevent passage of the Taurus until
June. I am supporting Thermus, as you request, by frequent letters. As
for P. Valerius, Deiotarus says that he has nothing and is his
pensioner. When you know whether there are to be additions to the
calendar at Rome or not, please write me positive news as to the date of
the Mysteries. I look forward to your letters rather less eagerly than
if you were in town; still I do look forward to them.

[Sidenote: _Laodicea, Feb. 23_, B.C. _50_]

I got your letter on the 5th day before the Terminalia[202] at Laodicea.
I was delighted at its tone of affection, kindness, and obliging zeal. I
will not pay “gold for brass” (for that is what you ask for), nor will I
start an arrangement of my own, but will keep to your order. You say
that the last letter you got from me was from Cybistra dated the 21st of
September, and you want to know which of yours I have received. Almost
all you mention except those which you say were entrusted to Lentulus’
servants at Equotuticus and Brundisium. So your energy is not a dead
loss as you fear, but has been well spent, if you aimed at giving me
pleasure. For nothing has ever given me more pleasure.

I am exceedingly glad that you approve of my reserve in the case of
Appius and my generosity even in the matter of your friend Brutus. I had
feared you might not quite like it. For Appius on his journey sent me
two or three letters showing pique, because I revoked some of his
enactments. It is as if a doctor, when a patient has been placed under
the care of another, should be angry with his successor for changing his
prescription. So Appius, having starved the province, let blood, and
tried every lowering treatment, hands it to me drained of

  i.e. the 19th of Feb., the Terminalia being on the 23rd.

προσανατρεφομένην eam a me non libenter videt, sed modo suscenset, modo
gratias agit. Nihil enim a me fit cum ulla illius contumelia; tantum
modo dissimilitudo meae rationis offendit hominem. Quid enim potest esse
tam dissimile quam illo imperante exhaustam esse sumptibus et iacturis
provinciam, nobis eam obtinentibus nummum nullum esse erogatum nec
privatim nec publice? Quid dicam de illius praefectis, comitibus,
legatis etiam? de rapinis, de libidinibus, de contumeliis? Nunc autem
domus mehercule nulla tanto consilio aut tanta disciplina gubernatur aut
tam modesta est quam nostra tota provincia. Haec non nulli amici Appi
ridicule interpretantur, qui me idcirco putent bene audire velle, ut
ille male audiat, et recte facere non meae laudis, sed illius
contumeliae causa. Sin Appius, ut Bruti litterae, quas ad te misit,
significabant, gratias nobis agit, non moleste fero, sed tamen eo ipso
die, quo haec ante lucem scribebam, cogitabam eius multa inique
constituta et acta tollere.

Nunc venio ad Brutum, quem ego omni studio te auctore sum complexus,
quem etiam amare coeperam: sed ilico me revocavi, ne te offenderem. Noli
enim putare me quicquam maluisse, quam ut mandatis satis facerem, nee
ulla de re plus laborasse. Mandatorum autem mihi libellum dedit,
isdemque de rebus tu mecum egeras. Omnia sum diligentissime persecutus.

life and cannot bear to see it being fed up by me. Sometimes he is
angry, sometimes he thanks me; for no act of mine has reflected on his
policy. It is only the difference of my _regime_ that annoys him. There
is a very wide difference between a province worn out by expense and
losses under his rule and not having to pay a penny out of private or
public purse under my administration. I need not mention his prefects,
his staff and his legates, the acts of robbery, of rape and insult. But
now, upon my word, no private house is managed with such judgement or
such economy, or is so well ordered as my whole province. Some friends
of Appius put an absurd construction on my policy and declare that I am
seeking popularity to damage him, and am acting honourably, not for the
sake of my own reputation, but to cause him shame. However, if Appius,
as the letter from Brutus which you forward to me shows, expresses his
thanks, I am content: but the very day on which I write this letter
before dawn I am thinking of annulling many of his wrong enactments and
decisions.

I come now to the matter of Brutus. On your advice I zealously
cultivated his friendship, I had even begun to feel a real liking for
him: but there I pull myself up for fear I should vex you. For do not
imagine that there is anything I should prefer better than to execute
his commission, or anything on which I have taken more pains. He gave me
a volume of commissions, and you spoke to me about his affairs. I have
done my best with all of them; first of all I induced Ariobarzanes to
pay him the money he promised me. So long as his highness was with me
the business was on a good footing: but later the king was dunned by
scores of agents from

abdicare aut ut pro Glabrione Scaevola faenus et impendium recusare. Ego
tamen, quas per te Bruto promiseram praefecturas, M. Scaptio, L. Gavio,

Pompey. Pompey has more influence than anyone for many reasons and
because it is rumoured that he will come to conduct the war against the
Parthians. Even to him however payment is made on the following terms.
On every thirtieth day some £8,000 is paid and that by tribute imposed
on the king’s subjects. Even such a sum will not cover the amount of
monthly interest. However our friend Gnaeus is an easy-going creditor.
He is willing to forgo his capital and is content with interest, and
that not in full. The king pays no one else and has no means to pay. He
has no treasury and no regular tribute: he levies taxes on the method of
Appius. They are scarcely sufficient to pay the interest on Pompey’s
money. His highness has two or three very wealthy friends, but they look
after their own pockets as well as you or I. Still I do not cease to
write dunning, coaxing and scolding his highness. Deiotarus too has told
me that he has sent messengers to him about his debt to Brutus: and they
came back with the reply that he has no assets. I can quite believe it,
for I have never seen a kingdom more plundered or a king more needy. So
I am thinking of resigning my guardianship, or, as Scaevola did for
Glabrio, of repudiating both capital and interest. However I have
conferred the office of prefect, which I promised Brutus through you, on
M. Scaptius and L. Gavius, who are his agents in the kingdom; for they
were not conducting their business in my province. You will remember
that my principle was that he might have as many offices of prefect at
his disposal as he liked, provided he did not give them to business men:
so I offered him

ei praeterea dederam. Sed ii, quibus petierat, de provincia decesserant.

Nunc cognosce de Salaminiis, quod video tibi etiam novum accidisse
tamquam mihi. Numquam enim ex illo audivi illam pecuniam esse suam; quin
etiam libellum ipsius habeo, in quo est: “Salaminii pecuniam debent M.
Scaptio et P. Matinio, familiaribus meis.” Eos mihi commendat; adscribit
etiam et quasi calcar admovet intercessisse se pro iis magnam pecuniam.
Confeceram, ut solverent centesimis sexennii ductis cum renovatione
singulorum annorum. At Scaptius quaternas postulabat. Metui, si
impetrasset, ne tu ipse me amare desineres; nam ab edicto meo
recessissem et civitatem in Catonis et in ipsius Bruti fide locatam
meisque beneficiis ornatam funditus perdidissem. Atque hoc tempore ipso
impingit mihi epistulam Scaptius Bruti rem illam suo periculo esse, quod
nec mihi umquam Brutus dixerat nec tibi, etiam ut praefecturam Scaptio
deferrem. Id vero per te exceperamus, ne negotiatori; quodsi cuiquam,
huic tamen non. Fuerat enim praefectus Appio et quidem habuerat turmas
equitum, quibus inclusum in curia senatum Salamine obsederat, ut fame
senatores quinque morerentur. Itaque ego, quo die tetigi provinciam, cum
mihi Cyprii legati Ephesum obviam venissent, litteras misi, ut equites
ex insula statim decederent. His de causis credo Scaptium iniquius de me
aliquid ad Brutum scripsisse. Sed tamen hoc sum animo.

two others besides. But the gentlemen for whom he asked them had left my
province.

Now to talk about the people of Salamis, a matter which I see came as a
surprise to you as it did to me. Brutus never told me that that money
was his. Indeed I have his own memorandum stating “The people of Salamis
owe money to M. Scaptius and P. Matinius, my friends.” He recommends
these gentlemen to me, and to spur me adds a postscript that he has gone
security to them for a large sum. I had arranged that they should pay in
compound interest for six years at 12 percent. But Scaptius demanded 48
per cent, I was afraid, if he got his request, that you too would cease
to be my friend, for I should have departed from the terms of my own
edict, and have ruined utterly a state enjoying the protection of Cato
and Brutus himself and distinguished by my attentions. At this very
point Scaptius thrusts a letter of Brutus into my hand, stating what
Brutus had never told me or you, that Brutus himself was the party
concerned, and asking me to give the office of prefect to his agent. But
that was the very proviso I had authorized you to make, that no office
could be given to a business man, above all to such a fellow as
Scaptius. For he had been a prefect of Appius, and indeed had had some
squadrons of cavalry, which he had used to beset the Senate at Salamis
in their own chamber, so that five Members of the House died of
starvation. Accordingly on the day I reached the province, since an
embassy from Cyprus had already met me at Ephesus, I sent orders that
his cavalry should leave the island at once. This, I fancy, had led
Scaptius to write somewhat bitterly about me to Brutus. However, my
attitude

Si Brutus putabit me quaternas centesimas oportuisse decernere, cum tota
provincia singulas observarem itaque edixissem, idque etiam acerbissimis
faeneratoribus probaretur, si praefecturam negotiatori denegatam
queretur, quod ego Torquato nostro in tuo Laenio, Pompeio ipsi in Sex.
Statio negavi et iis probavi, si equites deductos moleste feret,
accipiam equidem dolorem mihi illum irasci, sed multo maiorem non esse
eum talem, qualem putassem. Illud quidem fatebitur Scaptius, me ius
dicente sibi omnem pecuniam ex edicto meo auferendi potestatem fuisse.
Addo etiam illud, quod vereor tibi ipsi ut probem. Consistere usura
debuit, quae erat in edicto meo. Deponere volebant: impetravi a
Salaminiis, ut silerent. Veniam illi quidem mihi dederunt, sed quid iis
fiet, si huc Paulus venerit? Sed totum hoc Bruto dedi; qui de me ad te
humanissimas litteras scripsit, ad me autem, etiam cum rogat aliquid,
contumaciter, adroganter, ἀκοινονοήτως solet scribere. Tu autem velim ad
eum scribas de his rebus, ut sciam, quo modo haec accipiat; facies enim
me certiorem.

Atque haec superioribus litteris diligenter ad te perscripseram, sed
plane te intellegere volui mihi non excidisse illud, quod tu ad me
quibusdam litteris scripsisses, si nihil aliud de hac provincia nisi
illius benevolentiam deportassem, mihi id satis esse. Sit sane, quondam
ita tu vis, sed tamen cum eo, credo, quod

is this. If Brutus thinks that I ought to have allowed 48 per cent, when
throughout my province I have recognized only 12 per cent, and have
fixed this rate in my edict, with the approval of the most grasping
usurers; if he complains of my refusal to give office to a business man,
which I made also to our friend Torquatus in the case of your
acquaintance Laenius, and to Pompey himself in the case of Sex. Statius,
without annoying either of them; if he is angry at the disbanding of his
cavalry, well I shall be sorry that he is angry with me, but I shall be
far sorrier at discovering he is not the man I imagined he was. Scaptius
will admit that he had the opportunity of getting by my decision all the
money allowed by my edict. I will add a point which I fear you may not
like, the interest allowed by my edict ought to have ceased to run.[203]
The people of Salamis wished to deposit the sum in a temple; but I
begged them not to raise the point. They gave way to me: but what will
happen to them if Brutus’ brother-in-law, Paulus, comes here? I allowed
Brutus all this privilege: and he has written very kind letters about me
to you; but to me, even when he asks a favour, he writes in an arrogant,
bold tone and uncivilly. Please write to Brutus about the matter, that I
may know how he takes it. You can inform me.

To be sure, I had given you the full story in a former letter: but I
wanted you to understand clearly that I had not forgotten a remark in
one of your letters, that if I took nothing else away from this province
except Brutus’ good-will, that would be enough. Be it as you wish,
provided it can be so

filio. Ille vero ante decemviros non fuit, quippe qui aedilis curulis
fuerit, qui magistratus multis annis post decemviros institutus est.
Quid ergo profecit, quod protulit fastos? Occultatam putant quodam
tempore istam tabulam, ut dies agendi peterentur a paucis. Nec vero
pauci sunt auctores Cn. Flavium scribam fastos protulisse actionesque

rebus accepisse, unas a Pindenisso capto, alteras Laodicea,

without loss of honour to me. So I have given judgement that the payment
of the people of Salamis to Scaptius is good at law. The equity of this
course I will leave to your consideration. I will not even appeal to
Cato: but don’t think I have let slip your exhortations. They are fixed
in my heart. With tears in your eyes, you told me to think of my
reputation. Is there any letter of yours which does not touch on the
topic? So let who will be angry. I can put up with it. “The right is on
my side,” especially since I have bound myself to good conduct, with six
volumes[204] for bail. I am glad you like the books so much, though
there is one point of history which you question, that about Cn.
Flavius, the son of Annius. He did not flourish before the days of the
decemviri, since he held a curule aedileship, which was instituted long
after their time. What good then did he do by publishing the official
calendar? It is thought that at one time the calendar was not exposed in
public, so that a privileged few might be the sole source of information
as to days propitious for business. Moreover, several authorities
maintain that this Cn. Flavius was the first man to publish the calendar
and to draw up a digest of the forms of legal procedure. So don’t think
that I, or rather my spokesman Africanus, invented a fiction. You took
my remark about the actor’s mannerism, and suspected a satirical
meaning:[205] but I wrote in all _naïveté_. You tell me that Philotimus
wrote to you about my being hailed imperator; but I fancy that, now you
are in Epirus, you have got my two letters about the business, one from
Pindenissus after its capture, another from Laodicea, both

delivered to your slaves. For fear of accidents at sea, I sent the
public despatch on my campaign to Rome in duplicate by different
carriers.

As to my daughter Tullia I agree with you, and I have written to her and
her mother giving my consent. For a former letter of yours to me said “I
could wish you had returned to your old associates.” There was no
occasion to alter the letter that came from Memmius: for I much prefer
to accept this candidate from Pontidia than the other from Servilia. So
get our friend Saufeius to help you in this business. He always liked
me, and now I trust he will like me all the more, since he is bound to
have inherited his brother Appius’ liking for me along with the rest of
his inheritance, and Appius often expressed great affection for me,
especially in the trial of Bursa. Indeed you will relieve me of a source
of great anxiety.

I do not like Furnius’ proviso; there is nothing else I fear, except the
point which he makes his sole proviso.[206] I would write to you more
fully on the point, if you were in Rome. I am not surprised that you
depend entirely on Pompey for keeping the peace. That is quite right,
and I think you must delete your phrase “insincere.” If the order of my
paragraphs is muddled, you have yourself to blame, as I am following
your own harum-scarum way.

My son and nephew are fond of one another, learn their lessons and take
their exercise together: but to quote Isocrates’ remark about Ephorus
and Theopompus, one wants the rein and the other the spur.

I intend to celebrate Quintus’ coming of age[207] on the feast of
Bacchus.[208] His father asked me to do this, and I shall act on the
assumption that there will be no addition to the calendar. Dionysius is
in my good graces: but the boys say he is liable to mad fits of temper.
However one could not get a master of more learning and better character
and more liking for you and me. The praise you hear of Thermus and
Silius is deserved: they conduct themselves in very honourable fashion.
You may praise M. Nonius, Bibulus, and myself too, if you like. I only
wish Scrofa had scope for his tact. He is a fine fellow. The rest do
little credit to Cato’s caucus. I am much obliged to you for
recommending my case to Hortensius. As to Amianus Dionysius says there
is no help. I have met with no trace of Terentius. Moeragenes has
certainly been killed. I made a tour through his district and found not
a living thing. I did not know this, when I spoke to your agent
Democritus. I have ordered the Rhosian ware for you. But what the deuce
will you serve up in porcelain, when you are accustomed to give us
vegetarian fare on fern-pattern plates and in magnificent baskets? I
have ordered a horn for Phemius, and one will be got. I only hope that
his tune will be worthy of the instrument.

A war with the Parthians is imminent. Cassius’ despatch was futile,

to fear. Very good. Bibulus can check them for two months, but what will
happen to the man whom I leave behind, especially if he be my brother?
Or what will be my own fate, if I do not depart so speedily? It is a
great bother. However Deiotarus has decided to join my camp in full
force. He has thirty squadrons of four hundred men each armed in our
fashion, and two thousand cavalry. He can hold out till Pompey comes. A
letter he writes to me presumes that he will conduct the campaign. The
Parthians spend the winter in a Roman province. Orodes is expected in
person. You may take my word it is a big business.

As to Bibulus’ edict there is no new feature, except that proviso of
which you wrote “it is a very grave reflection on our order.”[209]
However I have a similar proviso, in more circumspect language, borrowed
from the Asiatic edict of Q. Mucius, son of Publius, “Provided that the
agreement is not such as contravenes equity.” I have followed Scaevola
in many details, among them in the stipulation which the Greeks hold as
the salvation of their freedom, that Greek cases are to be settled
according to Greek law. The edict is short on account of the division I
have made, as I considered it fell better under two heads. The one
concerns provincial matters and deals with town accounts, debt, the rate
of interest, contracts, and includes all matters referring to the
tax-collectors. The second head, embracing matters which cannot properly
be settled without an

edict, deals with inheritance, ownership and sale, the appointment of
official receivers, matters where suits are wont to be brought and
settled in accordance with the terms of an edict. A third head dealing
with the rest of judicial procedure I left unwritten. I stated that in
such matters my decrees would be based on those of Rome. I observe this
rule, and so far satisfy everybody. The Greeks are jubilant at having
foreign jurors. You may say that the jurors are wasters: however the
Greeks flatter themselves that they have got home rule, and your own
jurors are men of the lofty standing of Turpio the shoe maker and
Vettius the broker.

You ask how I am dealing with the tax-gatherers. I pet them, indulge
them, praise and honour them: and take care they trouble no one. It is
very odd that the rates of interest specified in their bonds were upheld
even by Servilius. My procedure is this. I name a day fairly remote,
before which, if the debtors pay up, I lay down that I shall allow only
12 per cent. But, if they have not paid, judgement will be according to
the bond. Accordingly the Greeks pay their debts at a fair rate of
interest, and the farmers are gratified, provided they get their fill of
compliments and invitations. In short, they are all so intimate with me
that each man thinks himself my special favourite. But still you know
the old saw.[210]

delightful feature of your letter, to my mind), do you really mean that

high near the temple of Ops has only the inscription COS. But the statue
near the Hercules of Polycles bears the inscription CENS.: and the pose,
the dress, the ring and the likeness prove that it is a statue of the
same person. As a matter of fact, when among the crowd of gilded knights
placed by Metellus on the Capitol, I noticed a likeness of Africanus
with the name Serapio on the pedestal, I thought it was a workman’s
error, but now I see it is Metellus’ mistake. What gross ignorance of
history! For that misconception about Flavius and the calendar, if it is
such, is widely held: and you were quite right in having doubts about
it. I have followed the view which is almost universal, as Greek authors
often do. Every one says that Eupolis, the poet of the old Comedy, was
thrown into the sea by Alcibiades on his voyage to Sicily. Eratosthenes
confutes this, producing plays exhibited by him after that date. But
that is no reason for laughing at Duris of Samos, who is an accurate
historian, because he follows a vulgar error. All historians agree that
Zaleucus drew up laws for the Locrians. It is not therefore fatal to
Theophrastus, if he is called to account for that by your friend
Timaeus. But not to know that one’s great-grandfather was not censor is
shocking, especially as after his consulship no Cornelius was censor
during his lifetime.

As for your remarks about Philotimus and the payment of £182,000,[213] I
hear that Philotimus came to the Chersonese about the beginning of
January, but so far I have heard nothing from him. Camillus writes that
he has received my balance. I don’t know how

Illud me, mi Attice, in extrema fere parte epistulae commovit; scribis
enim sic: Τί λοιπόν; deinde me obsecras amantissime, ne obliviscar
vigilare et ut animadvertam, quae fiant. Num quid de quo inaudisti? Etsi
nihil eius modi est; πολλοῦ γε καὶ δεῖ. Nec enim me fefellisset nec
fallet. Sed ista admonitio tua tam accurata nescio quid mihi significare
visa est.

De M. Octavio iterum iam tibi rescribo te illi probe respondisse; paulo
vellem fidentius. Nam Caelius libertum ad me misit et litteras accurate
scriptas et de pantheris et civitatibus. Rescripsi alterum me moleste
ferre, si ego in tenebris laterem, nec audiretur Romae nullum in mea
provincia nummum nisi in aes alienum erogari, docuique nec mihi
conciliare pecuniam licere nec illi capere monuique eum, quem plane
diligo, ut, cum alios accusasset, cautius viveret; illud autem alterum
alienum esse existumatione mea, Cibyratas imperio meo publice venari.

Lepta tua epistula gaudio exsultat; etenim scripta belle est meque apud
eum magna in gratia posuit. Filiola tua gratum mihi fecit, quod tibi
diligenter mandavit, ut mihi salutem adscriberes, gratum etiam Pilia,
sed illa officiosius, quod mihi, quem iam pridem numquam vidit. Igitur
tu quoque salutem

much it is, and I should like to know. However, we can discuss this
later and more conveniently when we meet.

That remark at the end of your letter, my dear Atticus, upset me. You
used the phrase, “What more is there to say,” and follow it by a most
affectionate warning not to forget to be on the watch and to keep an eye
on events. Have you heard anything about any of my staff? I am sure
there has been no wrong-doing, _pas du tout_. It could not have escaped
my notice, and it will not. But your earnest entreaty seemed to hint
something.

As for M. Octavius, I repeat that your reply was excellent. I could wish
it had been in more positive terms. For Caelius has sent me a freedman
of his and a carefully worded letter about panthers and an offer from
the townships to furnish contributions. I replied that the second item
is annoying, if my conduct is still a secret and the news has not
reached town that in my province no money is exacted except in
satisfaction of debts: and I have told him that it would be improper for
me to allow payment and for him to take it. I have a sincere regard for
him and have warned him that after his prosecution of other people he
should conduct himself on more careful lines. As to the second point I
have told him it would be a blot on my escutcheon that the people of
Cibyra should have a public hunt during my governorship.

Lepta leaps with joy over your letter: for it was nicely written and
puts me in his good graces. Your tiny daughter has done me a favour in
ordering you earnestly to send me her greetings. It was kind of Pilia
and very dutiful of your daughter to send greetings to one whom as yet
she has never met. So please

Tu velim, dum ero Laodiceae, id est ad Idus Maias, quam saepissime mecum

conlata), utique ad me tabellarios mittas. Et heus tu! iamne vos a

give my greetings to both of them in return. The date of your letter,
the last day of December, reminded me pleasantly of the famous and
unforgotten oath I took.[214] I was a Pompey in state robes that day.
There you have my answer to all your points: not as you asked “gold for
copper,” but like for like.

There was another short letter which I will not leave unanswered.
Lucceius to be sure was able to do something for the villa at Tusculum,
unless perhaps there was the old obstacle of the flute player[215]; and
I should like to know its condition. Our friend Lentulus I hear has
advertised all his property except that at Tusculum. I should like to
see these gentlemen free from debt as well as Sestius and you may add
Caelius too. To all of them one may apply the quotation, “ashamed to
refuse, but yet afraid to take.” I suppose you have heard of Curio’s
idea to recall Memmius. As for the debt due from Egnatius of Sidicinum,
I have some hope, but not much. Deiotarus is taking very great care of
Pinarius, whom you recommended to me, in a serious illness. So there is
my answer to your little letter.

While I am at Laodicea, which will be up to the 15th of May, please
correspond with me as often as possible, and on your arrival at Athens
at any rate send me letter carriers, since by that time we shall know
what has been done in town and about the provinces, of which the affairs
are settled in March. By the bye have you yet got Herodes to wring from
Caesar that £12,000? I hear you have excited the animosity of Pompey in
the matter. He thinks that

ex P. Vedio, magno nebulone, sed Pompei tamen familiari, audivi. Hic
Vedius mihi obviam venit cum duobus essedis et raeda equis iuncta et
lectica et familia magna, pro qua, si Curio legem pertulerit, HS
centenos pendat necesse est. Erat praeterea cynocephalus in essedo, nec
deerant onagri. Numquam vidi hominem nequiorem. Sed extremum audi.
Deversatus est Laodiceae apud Pompeium Vindullum. Ibi sua deposuit, cum
ad me profectus est. Moritur interim Vindullus; quae res ad Magnum

omnia obsignaret, in Vedianas res incidit. In his inventae sunt quinque
imagunculae matronarum, in quibus una sororis amici tui hominis “bruti,”
qui hoc utatur, et illius “lepidi,” qui haec tam neglegenter ferat. Haec
te volui παριστορῆσαι. Sumus enim ambo belle curiosi.

Unum etiam velim cogites. Audio Appium πρόπυλον Eleusine facere. Num
inepti fuerimus, si nos quoque Academiae fecerimus? “Puto,” inquies.

you have snapped up money which was his, and that it will not lessen
Caesar’s energy in building a palace near the sacred grove of Diana.
This bit of news came to me from P. Vedius, a shady character, but an
intimate of Pompey. The fellow met me on the road with two chariots, a
carriage and horses and a litter and a large following. If Curio carries
his law,[216] he will have to pay £l apiece. Besides other things, there
was a dog-faced baboon in a chariot, and some wild asses. I never met
such a rascal. But listen to the end of the story, At Laodicea Vedius
put up with Pompeius Vindullus, and left his belongings with him, while
he came to meet me. Meantime Vindullus died, and his property is
supposed to go to Pompeius Magnus. C. Vennonius went to the house and,
while sealing all the goods, found Vedius’ baggage. Among this baggage
there were five little busts of Roman married ladies, among them one of
the sister of your friend Brutus—a brute indeed to be acquainted with
the fellow—and one of the wife of Lepidus, whose easy conduct agrees
with the meaning of his name. I wanted to tell you this little tale _en
passant_, for we are both nice gossips.

There is one thing I wish you to consider. I hear that Appius is putting
up a porch at Eleusis. Shall I look a fool, if I do so in the Academy? I
dare say you may think so: say so plainly, if you do. I am very fond of
the city of Athens. I should like it to have some memorial of myself. I
dislike lying titles on the statues of other folk. But as you think
best. And please let me know the date of the

Your freedman Philogenes has come to visit me at Laodicea and tells me
that he is on the point of sailing to join you: so I give him this
letter in reply to your letter which I got from Brutus’ letter-carrier.
First I will answer your last page which caused me much concern:—that is
about Cincius’ communication on the talk he had with Statius. I was
particularly concerned at Statius’ remark that the plan had my approval.
Approval indeed! I need only say thus much. I wish the ties of
friendship to be as many and close as possible between us, though none
can be so close as those of our common liking. I am far from wanting the
tie between us to be relaxed. Quintus however to my knowledge will often
use bitter language on his private affairs, and often I have pacified
his anger, as I think you know. On my late tour or military campaign I
have seen him often fly in a temper and often calm again. I don’t know
what he wrote to Statius; whatever he meant to do, he ought not to have
informed a freedman. However I will do my best to prevent any course
contrary to our wishes and to propriety. In a case like this it is not
enough for a man to make himself responsible for his own conduct only:
and

  Cicero refers thus to the killing of Clodius on Jan. 18, 52 B.C.,

mirifice. Sed est magnum illud quidem, verum tamen multiplex pueri
ingenium; in quo ego regendo habeo negotii satis.

Quoniam respondi postremae tuae paginae prima mea, nunc ad primam
revertar tuam. Peloponnesias civitates omnes maritimas esse hominis non
nequam, sed etiam tuo iudicio probati, Dicaearchi, tabulis credidi. Is
multis nominibus in Trophoniana Chaeronis narratione Graecos in eo
reprendit, quod mare tantum secuti sint, nec ullum in Peloponneso locum
excipit. Cum mihi auctor placeret (etenim erat ἱστορικώτατος et vixerat
in Peloponneso), admirabar tamen et vix adcredens communicavi cum
Dionysio. Atque is primo est commotus, deinde, quod de isto Dicaearcho
non minus bene existumabat quam tu de C. Vestorio, ego de M. Cluvio, non
dubitabat, quin ei crederemus. Arcadiae censebat esse Lepreon quoddam
maritumum; Tenea autem et Aliphera ct Tritia νεόκτιστα ei videbantur,
idque τῷ τῶν νεῶν καταλόγῳ confirmabat, ubi mentio non fit istorum.
Itaque istum ego locum totidem verbis a Dicaearcho transtuli.
“Phliasios” autem dici sciebam, et ita fac ut habeas; nos quidem sic
habemus. Sed primo me ἀναλογία deceperat, Φλιοῦς, Ὀποῦς, Σιποῦς, quod
Ὀπούντιοι, Σιπούντιοι. Sed hoc continuo correximus.

Laetari te nostra moderatione et continentia video.

indeed the principal share of responsibility attaches to the boy, or
young man as he is now, Quintus. This I am always telling him. To me he
seems to love his mother greatly, as he should, and to be extremely fond
of you. He is a lad of high but complex character, and I have enough to
do to guide his conduct.

Having devoted my first page to answering your last, I will now return
to your first. I relied on the maps of Dicaearchus, a writer of no mean
standing and an authority you accept, for the information that all the
states of the Peloponnese bordered on the sea. In the account of the
cave of Trophonius, which he puts into the mouth of Chaeron, he blames
the Greeks on many scores for sticking to the sea coast; and he does not
except a single district in the Peloponnese. He was a very accurate
historian and lived in the Peloponnese, so that his evidence seemed
trustworthy. Still I was surprised and communicated my doubts to
Dionysius. Dionysius was startled at first, but finally accepted his
authority, since he had as good an opinion of Dicaearchus as you have of
C. Vestorius or I of M. Cluvius. Arcadia he agreed had a seaport
Lepreon: but Tenea, Aliphera and Tritia were, he considered, more
modern, a view he supported by the omission of these places from Homer’s
catalogue of the ships. Accordingly I borrowed the passage from
Dicaearchus in so many words. I know that Phliasii is the proper form.
Please make it so in your copy. I read it in mine. But first of all
thinking of Phlious I was misled by a vicious analogy of Opuntii from
Opous and Sipuntii from Sipous. But I altered it at once.

I see that you are pleased at my unselfish moderation.

et magna mihique nondum laboriosa ex illa vetere militia. Nonis Maiis in

You would be more pleased, if you were here. In this very assize which I
have been holding at Laodicea from the 13th of February to the 1st of
May for all the districts except Cilicia, I have done wonders. See how
many states have been freed from debt and how many have had their burden
lightened. All have revived on acquiring home rule, and using their own
enactments in law. I have given them in two ways the chance of freeing
themselves or relieving themselves from debt. First by causing them no
expense during my administration (and in saying no expense I mean
literally not one farthing), which has helped them astonishingly out of
their trouble. Secondly the states had suffered from surprising
corruption in their own countrymen, that is to say their magistrates. I
questioned the men who had held the office of magistrate during the last
ten years. They concealed nothing. So without exposure they took on
their own backs the repayment of the money: and the communities which
had paid the tax-farmers nothing for the present five years have now
without any complaints paid up arrears for the last five years too. So I
am the apple of their eye to the tax-farmers. “Grateful fellows,” you
exclaim. Yes I have experienced their gratitude. The rest of my judicial
conduct has been enlightened, but mild and marvellously courteous. There
has been none of the difficulty of access so characteristic of
provincial governors; and no backstairs jobbery. Before daybreak I walk
up and down in my house, as I did of yore when a candidate for office.
This is popular and a great boon, and I have not felt it a burden owing
to my old training.

On the 15th of May I intend to go to Cilicia.

quantum, non plane, quia longe absum, scio. Salaminios autem (hos enim
poteram coërcere) adduxi, ut totum nomen Scaptio vellent solvere, sed

renovatis quotannis. Numerabantur nummi: noluit Scaptius. Tu qui ais
Brutum cupere aliquid perdere? Quaternas habebat in syngrapha. Fieri non
poterat, nec, si posset, ego pati possem. Audio omnino Scaptium

After spending the month of June there (and I pray it may be in peace,
for a serious war with the Parthians is certainly coming), July I shall
spend on my journey home. I shall have served my year on July the 30th.
I have great hopes that my tenure of office may not be extended. I have
the city gazette up to the 7th of March. I gather that, thanks to the
persistence of my friend Curio, appointments to the province will be the
last business to be considered. So, as I hope, I shall see you soon.

I come now to Brutus, your friend or rather mine, since you prefer it. I
have done everything that I could accomplish in my own province or
attempt in the kingdom of Cappadocia. I have taken every measure with
the king and still do so daily—by letter. The king himself was in my
company only for three or four days and at a crisis in his affairs, from
which I released him. But both then in person and subsequently in
repeated letters I have continually begged and besought him in my own
name and advised and persuaded him in his own interest. My efforts have
borne fruit: but how much at this distance I cannot tell for certain.
The people of Salamis however, whom I could influence, I have induced to
consent to settle all their debt with Scaptius, but with interest at 12
per cent calculated from the date of the last contract, and not at
simple but compound interest. The money was counted down: but Scaptius
refused to take it. What kind of a figure do you cut, who say that
Brutus will make a sacrifice? Forty-eight per cent was written in the
bond. It was an impossible sum. It could not be paid nor could I have
permitted it. I hear after all that

paenitere. Nam, quod senatus consultum esse dicebat, ut ius ex syngrapha
diceretur, eo consilio factum est, quod pecuniam Salaminii contra legem
Gabiniam sumpserant. Vetabat autem Auli lex ius dici de ita sumpta
pecunia. Decrevit igitur senatus, ut ius diceretur ex ista syngrapha.
Nunc ista habet iuris idem quod ceterae, nihil praecipui. Haec a me
ordine facta puto me Bruto probaturum; tibi nescio; Catoni certe
probabo.

Sed iam ad te ipsum revertor. Ain tandem, Attice, laudator integritatis
et elegantiae nostrae,

                      “ausus es hoc ex ore tuo——,”

inquit Ennius, ut equites Scaptio ad pecuniam cogendam darem, me rogare?
An tu, si mecum esses, qui scribis morderi te interdum, quod non simul
sis, paterere me id facere, si vellem? “Non amplius,” inquis,
“quinquaginta.” Cum Spartaco minus multi primo fuerunt. Quid tandem isti
mali in tam tenera insula non fecissent? Non fecissent autem? immo quid
ante adventum meum non fecerunt? Inclusum in curia senatum habuerunt
Salaminium ita multos dies, ut interierint non nulli fame. Erat enim
praefectus Appi Scaptius et habebat turmas ab Appio. Id me igitur tu,
cuius mehercule os mihi ante oculos solet versari, cum de aliquo officio
ac laude cogito, tu me, inquam, rogas, praefectus ut Scaptius sit? Alias
hoc statueramus, ut negotiatorem neminem, idque Bruto probaramus. Habeat
is turmas? Cur potius quam

Scaptius is sorry. As to his argument from a decree of the Senate
ordering judgement to be given according to the bond, the reason for
that was that in borrowing the money the people of Salamis contravened
the law of Gabinius. Aulus’ law forbade that judgement should be given
for money so borrowed. So the Senate decreed that judgement might be
given on that particular bond. Now the bond in question has the same
validity as other bonds, and no special privilege. I fancy Brutus will
admit that my behaviour has been proper. I do not know if you will take
that view, but certainly Cato will.

Now I come back to yourself. My dear friend, you have praised the nice
honour of my conduct “and can you dare with your own mouth,” as Ennius
says, ask me to give Scaptius cavalry to collect his debts? Or would
you, if you were here,—you who say that you chafe sometimes at not being
with me,—would you suffer me to do such a thing, if I wanted? “Not more
than fifty men,” you say. Spartacus had fewer men than that at first.
The blackguards would have done indescribable damage in such a weak
island. Do you say, they would have refrained? Look at the damage they
did before I came here. They kept the members of the local Senate
prisoners in their Chamber for so long that some died of hunger. For
Scaptius was a prefect of Appius, and was allowed some cavalry. Your
face is always before my eyes, when I think of duty and honour, and can
you, you, I repeat, ask me to give the fellow the office of prefect? I
had settled in other cases never to give the office to a man of
business, a course which had won the approval of Brutus: and is a fellow
like Scaptius to have cavalry? Why should he not be content with a

cohortes? Sumptu iam nepos evadit Scaptius. “Volunt,” inquit,
“principes.” Scio; nam ad me Ephesum usque venerunt flentesque equitum
scelera et miserias suas detulerunt. Itaque statim dedi litteras, ut ex
Cypro equites ante certam diem decederent, ob eamque causam, tum ob
ceteras Salaminii nos in caelum decretis suis sustulerunt. Sed iam quid
opus equitatu? solvunt enim Salaminii; nisi forte id volumus armis
efficere, ut faenus quaternis centesimis ducant. Et ego audebo legere
umquam aut attingere eos libros, quos tu dilaudas, si tale quid fecero?
Nimis, inquam, in isto Brutum amasti, dulcissime Attice, nos vereor ne
parum. Atque haec scripsi ego ad Brutum scripsisse te ad me. Cognosce
nunc cetera.

Pro Appio nos hic omnia facimus, honeste tamen, sed plane libenter. Nec

company of foot? He is beginning to live in spendthrift style. The
leading people of Salamis insist, he declares. Of course; that is why
they came to me and with tears told me of his men’s atrocities and their
own miseries. Accordingly I sent a letter at once ordering the cavalry
to quit Cyprus by a certain day, and that, as well as other acts of
mine, has caused the people of Salamis to praise me to the skies in
their decrees. There is no need of cavalry now, for the people are ready
to pay,—unless perhaps I want to use force to make them pay 48 per cent
interest. Were I to do such a thing, I could never venture to read or
touch those volumes which you praise. You, my dear fellow, have had far
too much regard for Brutus in the matter. I perhaps not enough. I have
informed Brutus of the drift of your letter. Now for the remaining
topics.

I am pleased to do all I can for Appius here consistently with my
honour. I do not dislike him and I like Brutus: and Pompey, for whom I
have a higher regard every day, is surprisingly importunate. You have
heard that C. Caelius comes here as quaestor. I don’t know why, but I
don’t like that affair of Pammenes. I hope to be at Athens in the month
of September. Please let me know the dates of your travels. I understood
the _naïveté_ of Sempronius Rufus from your letter written in Corcyra. I
am really quite jealous of the influence Of Vestorius.

I should like to keep on chatting, but day dawns, the crowd is pressing
in and Philogenes is in a hurry. Good-bye, give my greetings to Pilia,
when you write, and to your daughter: and accept greetings from my son.

Though I have no fresh news, since I handed a letter for you to your
freedman Philogenes, still I must write you a line, since I am sending
Philotimus back to Rome. First a thing which gives me much anxiety—not
that you can help me at all—for the business is in hand, and you are far
away in a foreign land

               “and by south wind tossed
               Between us rolls the wide estranging sea.”

The days steal on, as you see (for I am due to leave my province on the
30th of July), and no successor is appointed. Whom can I leave in
charge? Policy and public opinion point to my brother: first because it
is right that he should have the honour by preference to anyone else,
and secondly because he is the only officer of praetorian rank that I
have: for Pomptinus, who came out on that condition, has left me already
according to his agreement. My quaestor is notoriously unsuitable; he is
“unsteady, wanton and lightfingered.” There is one objection to my
brother’s appointment,—he will probably refuse, as he hates provincial
life. Certes, it is a hateful bore. Then, supposing he does not like to
refuse, what is my proper course? Seeing that a great war is likely in
Syria, which will apparently break forth into this district, where there
is no protection and only the ordinary supplies have been voted for the
year, it would certainly seem unnatural to leave my brother, and
careless to leave some nincompoop. As you see I am troubled greatly and
badly want advice. In short I

toto negotio nobis opus non fuit. Quanto tua provincia melior! Decedes,
cum voles, nisi forte iam decessisti; quem videbitur, praeficies
Thesprotiae et Chaoniae. Necdum tamen ego Quintum conveneram, ut iam, si
id placeret, scirem, possetne ab eo impetrari: nee tamen, si posset,
quid vellem, habebam. Hoc est igitur eius modi.

Reliqua plena adhuc et laudis et gratiae, digna iis libris, quos
dilaudas, conservatae civitates, cumulate publicanis satis factum,
offensus contumelia nemo, decreto iusto et severo perpauci, nec tamen
quisquam, ut queri audeat, res gestae dignae triumpho; de quo ipso nihil
cupide agemus, sine tuo quidem consilio certe nihil. Clausula est
difficilis in tradenda provincia. Sed haec deus aliquis gubernabit.

De urbanis rebus scilicet plura tu scis; saepius et certiora audis;
equidem doleo non me tuis litteris certiorem fieri. Huc enim odiosa
adferebantur de Curione, de Paulo; non quo ullum periculum videam stante

si iam es Romae aut cum eris, velim mittas, quae mihi obviam veniat, ex

paene praeterii, Bruti tui causa,

made a mistake over the whole matter. Your sphere is far preferable. You
can depart at pleasure; and perhaps you have left already. You can put
Thesprotia and Chaonia[218] in charge of anyone you like. I have not yet
met my brother to know whether he would consent, if I want him to take
it over; nor, should he consent, am I settled in my plans. So much for
that.

The rest so far is full of honour and glory and worthy of the volumes
which you praise. Communities have found salvation, the whole body of
tax-collectors has been satisfied, no one has been annoyed by
ill-considered conduct, very few by the severity of upright justice—none
so that he could dare complain—and a campaign has been conducted in a
way that deserves a triumph, though I shall not seek it greedily, nor
seek it at all without your advice. The conclusion is difficult in the
matter of handing over the province. But some god will direct my course.

About doings in town of course you know more, as your information comes
more frequently and more surely. I am sorry that you do not pass on your
news in a letter, for tiresome tidings have reached me about Curio and
Paulus, not that there would seem anything to fear, if Pompey keeps his
influence or even his inactivity. Only let him recover his health. But I
am annoyed for Curio and Paulus, my friends. So, if you are now in town,
or when you are there, please send me a sketch of the political
situation to meet me on my way, that I may mould my conduct upon it and
bethink me of the proper spirit in which to approach Rome. It is
something not to arrive as a foreigner and a stranger. There was one
point I nearly omitted. As I have said often, I have

ut saepe ad te scripsi, feci omnia. Cyprii numerabant; sed Scaptius
centesimis renovato in singulos annos faenore contentus non fuit.
Ariobarzanes non in Pompeium prolixior per ipsum quam per me in Brutum.
Quem tamen ego praestare non poteram; erat enim rex perpauper, aberamque
ab eo ita longe, ut nihil possem nisi litteris; quibus pugnare non
destiti. Summa haec est. Pro ratione pecuniae liberalius est Brutus
tractatus quam Pompeius. Bruto curata hoc anno talenta circiter c,
Pompeio in sex mensibus promissa cc. Iam in Appi negotio quantum
tribuerim Bruto, dici vix potest. Quid est igitur, quod laborem? Amicos
habet meras nugas, Matinium, Scaptium. Qui quia non habuit a me turmas
equitum, quibus Cyprum vexaret, ut ante me fecerat, fortasse suscenset,
aut quia praefectus non est, quod ego nemini tribui negotiatori, non C.
Vennonio, meo familiari, non tuo, M. Laenio, et quod tibi Romae
ostenderam me servaturum; in quo perseveravi. Sed quid poterit queri is,
qui, auferre pecuniam cum posset, noluit? Scaptio, qui in Cappadocia
fuit, puto esse satis factum. Is a me tribunatum cum accepisset, quem
ego ex Bruti litteris ei detulissem, postea scripsit ad me se uti nolle
eo tribunatu.

Gavius est quidam, cui cum praefecturam detulissem Bruti rogatu, multa
et dixit et fecit cum quadam mea contumelia, P. Clodi canis. Is me nec
proficiscentem Apameam prosecutus est, nec, cum postea in castra
venisset atque inde discederet, num quid vellem, rogavit, et fuit aperte
mihi nescio quare

done everything for your friend Brutus. The people of Cyprus were paying
down the money. Scaptius was not content with 12 per cent compound
interest. Ariobarzanes is not more accommodating to Pompey for his own
sake than to Brutus for mine. Still I could not go bail for him, for he
is a very needy monarch and I was such a long way off that I could only
press him on paper, as I did continually. The conclusion is this. In
proportion to the sum lent, Brutus has been treated more liberally than
Pompey: for Brutus there has been got this year about £24,400. To Pompey
has been promised £48,800 within six months. In the business of Appius,
my concessions to Brutus are almost incalculable. I have no reason to
distress myself. Brutus’ friends are men of straw, Matinius, and
Scaptius, who is perhaps angry because he could not get troops to harry
Cyprus as he had done before my time, or because he was not made a
prefect, an office I have not granted to any man of business, not to C.
Vennonius, my friend, nor to your friend M. Laenius. I have persevered
in the course that I told you at Rome I should keep: but a man who
refused to take his money, when he could, cannot grumble. The other
Scaptius who was in Cappadocia I think is satisfied. First of all he
accepted a military tribuneship from me, which a letter from Brutus had
persuaded me to offer him; but he wrote me afterwards that he did not
want to take it up.

There is a person Gavius, who, after I had offered him a post as prefect
at Brutus’ request, said and did a good deal to disparage me. He is
Clodius’ puppydog. He did not condescend to be one of my escort when I
left Apamea, nor, when he came into camp later and was leaving it, did
he ask if I had any commissions. For some unknown reason he was an

non amicus. Hunc ego si in praefectis habuissem, quem tu me hominem
putares? Qui, ut scis, potentissimorum hominum contumaciam numquam
tulerim, ferrem huius adseculae? etsi hoc plus est quam ferre, tribuere
etiam aliquid beneficii et honoris. Is igitur Gavius, cum Apameae me
nuper vidisset Romam proficiscens, me ita appellavit, ut Culleolum vix
auderem: “Unde,” inquit, “me iubes petere cibaria praefecti?” Respondi
lenius, quam putabant oportuisse, qui aderant, me non instituisse iis
dare cibaria, quorum opera non essem usus. Abiit iratus. Huius nebulonis
oratione si Brutus moveri potest, licebit eum solus ames, me aemulum non
habebis. Sed illum eum futurum esse puto, qui esse debet. Tibi tamen
causam notam esse volui et ad ipsum haec perscripsi diligentissime.
Omnino (soli enim sumus) nullas umquam ad me litteras misit Brutus, ne
proxime quidem de Appio, in quibus non inesset adrogans, ἀκοινονόητον
aliquid. Tibi autem valde solet in ore esse:

[Sidenote: Lucilius.]

                                        “Granius autem
              Non contemnere se et reges odisse superbos.”

In quo tamen ille mihi risum magis quam stomachum movere solet. Sed
plane parum cogitat, quid scribat aut ad quem.

Q. Cicero puer legit, ut opinor, et certe, epistulam inscriptam patri
suo. Solet enim aperire idque de meo consilio, si quid forte sit, quod
opus sit sciri. In ea autem epistula erat idem illud de sorore quod ad
me. Mirifice conturbatum vidi puerum. Lacrimans

open enemy of mine. If I had counted such a fellow among my prefects,
you might doubt what kind of creature I am. You know I will not brook
discourtesy from men of power, and should I put up with it from this
hanger-on? Though, to be sure, gracious bestowal of honour is something
more than putting up with a man. So Gavius, when on his road to Rome he
saw me lately at Apamea, addressed me as I should scarcely address
Culleolus. “Where,” said he, “am I to look for my pickings?” I answered
less sternly than those present thought proper, that I was not
accustomed to give pickings to men whose services I had not used. He
went off in a temper. If Brutus listens to the talk of such a shady
customer, you may have him to yourself. I shall not be your rival. But I
think he will behave all right. However I wanted you to know the
circumstances, and I have recounted the matter very fully to Brutus.
Between ourselves Brutus has never sent me a letter, not even lately
about Appius, without a touch of arrogance and intolerance. You often
quote the lines,

                                      “But Granius too
            Has self-conceit and hates the pride of kings.”

However in this business he excites my laughter rather than my rage, and
evidently he does not consider sufficiently what he writes and to whom.

The young Quintus, I fancy, yes I am sure, read your letter addressed to
his father, for he usually opens his father’s letters—and that by my
advice—in case there is anything he ought to know. The letter contained
that same passage about your sister that you wrote to me. The boy was
awfully upset. He

Ne illud quidem praetermittam. Hortensius filius fuit Laodiceae
gladiatoribus flagitiose et turpiter. Hunc ego patris causa vocavi ad
cenam, quo die venit, et eiusdem patris causa nihil amplius. Is mihi

came to me complaining in tears. I saw much good feeling in him, and a
kind and courteous disposition, which increases my hope for a
satisfactory issue to the matter: so I want you to know it.

There is one thing I must not pass over. The young Hortensius, during
the gladiatorial exhibition at Laodicea, behaved in a shameful and
scandalous way. For his father’s sake I invited him to my table on the
day of his arrival, and for the same father’s sake treated him
handsomely.[219] He said that he would await my departure in Athens,
that we might go home together. I could only say, “Very well.” But I
don’t fancy at all that he meant what he said. I hope not, lest I offend
his father, who is my very good friend. But if he comes in my suite, I
will arrange so as to avoid offence to a man I don’t want to offend.

So much for that, there is one thing more. Please send me Q. Celer’s

there is no news, write to say so, or even send a verbal message. Give
my love to your wife and daughter. Keep well.

Caelius I hear nothing. The proper thing seems to be to leave my brother

business altogether. But fortune must look to it, since reason serves
our purpose little.

You, having come safe to Rome, as I hope, will as usual look to
everything that concerns me, especially the matter of my daughter, about

noticed something. Look into this matter yourself alone, and secure what

You must certainly be at Rome now. If you are, I am glad of your safe
arrival. So long as you were away from town, you seemed to me to be
further off than if you were in Rome, for I heard less of my own
business and less of the business of the state. So please send plenty of
chatty letters on every kind of subject to meet me, though I hope, when
you read this, I shall be well on my journey home. Above all write me on
the subject I raised in my former letter. From the stuttering hesitation
of my wife’s freedman in our meetings and talks I infer that he has been
cooking his accounts a little in the matter of the sale of the
Crotonian’s[221] goods. Investigate the matter with your usual care, but
pay still more attention to this. When leaving the city of the seven
hills he tendered an account of debts of some £100 and £200[222] to
Camillus, and put himself down as owing £100 from Milo’s goods and £200
from the property in the Chersonese, and as having inherited two sums of
£2,600,[223] of which not a penny had been paid, though all were due on
the 1st of the second month. Milo’s freedman, Timotheus, the namesake of
Conon’s father, he said, had never given a thought to the matter. Now
first try and secure the whole amount, and secondly don’t overlook the
interest from the afore-mentioned day. All the time I had to endure him,
I was much upset. He came to me to spy out

reliqui), sollicitudine provinciae tamen vel maxime urgebamur. Cum enim
arderet Syria bello, et Bibulus in tanto maerore suo maximam curam belli
sustineret, ad meque legati eius et quaestor et amici eius litteras
mitterent, ut subsidio venirem, etsi exercitum infirmum habebam, auxilia
sane bona, sed ea Galatarum, Pisidarum, Lyciorum (haec enim sunt nostra
robora), tamen esse officium meum putavi exercitum habere quam proxume
hostem, quoad mihi praeesse provinciae per senatus consultum liceret.
Sed, quo ego maxime delectabar, Bibulus molestus mihi non erat, de
omnibus rebus scribebat ad me potius. Et mihi decessionis dies λεληθότως
obrepebat. Qui cum advenerit, ἄλλο πρόβλημα, quem praeficiam, nisi
Caldus quaestor venerit; de quo adhuc nihil certi habebamus.

Cupiebam mehercule longiorem epistulam facere, sed nec erat res, de qua
scriberem, nec iocari prae cura poteram. Valebis igitur et puellae
salutem Atticulae dices nostraeque Piliae.

the land, and had some hopes. When he lost them, he left without an
explanation, saying: “I give in, ’Twere shame to tarry long,” and
casting in my teeth the old proverb “take the goods the gods provide
you.”[224] Look after the rest, and let us investigate the matter as
thoroughly as possible.

Though I have nearly served my year (for only thirty-three days remain),
still I am greatly concerned about my province. Syria is ablaze with
war, and Bibulus is burdened with its cares in the midst of his own
great sorrow,[225] and his legates, quaestor and friends write to me to
go to his aid: so, although the army I have is weak—the auxiliaries
certainly are good, Galatians, Pisidians, Lycians, the main strength of
my force—I have thought it my duty to keep an army facing the foe, so
long as I am authorized by the Senate’s decree to be in charge of my
province. But what pleases me greatly is that Bibulus gives no trouble.
He writes to me about any other topic by preference, and the day of my
departure creeps on unnoticed. When it arrives, there is the further
problem of my substitute, unless my quaestor Caldus comes, of whom so
far I have no news.

I should like to write a longer letter, but I have no news, and care
keeps me from jesting; so good-bye, and love to your little daughter and
to your wife.

While in my province I show Appius every honour, suddenly I find myself
father-in-law of Dolabella his accuser. You invoke heaven’s benison. So
say I, and you I know are sincere. Believe me, it was the last thing I
had expected. Indeed I had even sent trusty agents to Terentia and
Tullia about the suit of Ti. Nero, who had made proposals to me: but
they arrived in town only when the betrothal was over. However I hope
the better course has been taken. I understand that my women folk are
highly pleased with the young man’s obliging and courteous temper. As
for the rest, don’t pick holes in him.

Good gracious! Do you approve of corn doles to Athens? My own books to
be sure do not forbid such a dole, for it was not a largesse to
fellow-citizens, but a graceful present in return for hospitality. Still
do you encourage me in the matter of the porch for the Academy, when
Appius has abandoned his design of a porch at Eleusis? I am sure you are
sorry about the news of Hortensius. Personally I am distracted: for it
had been my intention to live on intimate terms with him.

I have put Caelius in charge of my province. “A mere boy” you will
object, “and perhaps silly, and lacking in dignity and self-control.” I
agree; but there was no alternative. The letter I got from you some time
ago, in which you said you suspended judgement as to what I ought to do
about my substitute, caused me a pang; for I understood the grounds

Puero tradere? fratri autem? Illud non utile nobis. Nam praeter fratrem
nemo erat, quem sine contumelia quaestori, nobili praesertim,

relinquere aut etiam rei publicae causa contra senatus consultum ipse
remanere. Qui posteaquam incredibili felicitate discesserunt, sublata
dubitatio est. Videbam sermones: “Hui, fratrem reliquit! Num est hoc non
plus annum obtinere provinciam? Quid, quod senatus eos voluit praeesse
provinciis, qui non praefuissent? At hic triennium!” Ergo haec ad

of your hesitation and felt them myself. Could I hand it over to a boy?
But ought I to hand it over to my brother? The latter is prejudicial to
my own interests. My brother was the only man it would not be an insult
to prefer to the quaestor, especially as that officer was of noble
birth. Still, while the Parthians seemed threatening, I determined to
leave my brother in charge, or even to run counter to the decree of the
Senate and for the sake of the Republic remain here myself. Their
marvellously opportune retirement removed my doubts. I foresaw the
world’s comment. “So he has left his brother in charge! Is this holding
a province for one year only? And what about the decree of the Senate
that ex-governors should not be eligible? Why, his brother was governor
for three years.” These are the arguments for the public; but for you I
have private reasons. I should have been in constant anxiety as to some
exhibition of temper or overbearingness or negligence; for such things
will happen. Perhaps his son, a mere headstrong lad, would have given me
cause for distress: his father would not send him away, and was annoyed
with you for saying that he ought. As for Caelius, I cannot say that I
am unconcerned about his past behaviour: but still I am far less
concerned. Then there is another point. Pompey (and think of his power
and position) chose Q. Cassius without regard to the lot, and Caesar too
chose Antony. I could not affront Caelius who had been given to me by
lot, and so make him a spy on the actions of my successor. No; my
present course is better, accords well with precedent and is well suited
to my time of life. But,

Just as I had determined to write to you and had taken up my pen,
Batonius came straight from his ship to my house at Ephesus and gave me
your letter on the 29th of September. I am delighted about your good
voyage, and your opportune meeting with your wife and also at her
remarks about the marriage of my daughter. But Batonius brought news
that was simply awful about Caesar, and was even more frank in
conversation with Lepta. I hope his news is false: it was certainly
terrifying. He says that Caesar will refuse to disband his army, that
the officials elect, praetors, Cassius the tribune and Lentulus the
consul take his part, and that Pompey thinks of leaving Rome.

But by the by, are you so sorry for the fellow that thinks himself
superior to the uncle of your sister’s son? What fine opponents to beat
him! But to business.

The Etesian winds have hindered me much: the open Rhodian boats too
caused me a delay of exactly twenty days. On the 1st of October, as I am

and you thought that it was nothing serious and that he had gathered as
much from your people. This view seemed to be supported by a remark at
the end of your letter that at the time of writing you had a touch of
fever. However I was greatly surprised and pleased at your writing to me
in your own hand under the circumstances. So I will say no more. For I
hope considering your careful and temperate life—and to be sure Acastus
bids me be confident—that you are now as well as I could wish.

I am glad you got my letter from Turranius. Keep a very strict eye, as
you love me, on the untimely designs of that cooker of accounts
Philotimus. As to this legacy from Precius, which is a great sorrow to
me—for I loved him indeed—don’t let the fellow lay a finger on it, small
as it is. You will say that I want money for the outfit of my triumph.
You shall see that following your advice I will not show foolish vanity
in seeking a triumph, nor be phlegmatic enough to refuse it.

I gather from your letter that you heard from Turranius I had given over
my province to my brother. Do you imagine that I overlooked the cautious
tone of your letter? You wrote that you were doubtful. There could have
been no reason for doubts, if there had been grounds for leaving a
brother and such a brother in charge. I took your doubts for dogmatic
rejection. You warn me on no account to leave the young Quintus. Your
words repeat my dream. The same vision came to us both, as though we had
talked it over. There was nothing else to be done, and your long doubt
has relieved me of hesitation. But I fancy you must have already got a
letter on this topic written in more detail.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
