PREFACE


To teachers and the public alike, probably no subject taught in
the public schools has been more disappointing than spelling. This
disappointment is undoubtedly due to:

1. Defective material for study and poor methods of teaching;

2. Too much testing and too little teaching;

3. Finding errors rather than preventing them;

4. The use of a theoretical, rather than the practical, vocabulary of
children and adults.

The teaching of spelling must be done from a spelling book in the hands
of the children, since the individual teacher does not have the time to
prepare lists of words which will produce as good results as the lists
given in a spelling book, the selection and preparation of which are the
result of years of special observation and testing.

A plan of teaching spelling to secure the best results should consist of
a thoughtful, systematic, and comprehensive presentation of the words and
spelling facts which every pupil must learn. It must contain an adequate
and simple system of phonics for the primary grades, since a large
percentage of the words in common use are purely phonetic and present no
spelling difficulties once a sane and practical phonetic foundation is
fixed. It must have a vocabulary selected and graded with such care that
it will give the child the ability to spell correctly those words which
he needs to use in his written work, and that it will also develop and
broaden his vocabulary for his future needs. It should contain suitable
directions and hints to the teacher, sufficiently removed from the
pupil’s text so that he may not be confused by them. It may, and in many
grades should, contain information and suggestions to the pupil that will
help him to master the many peculiarly non-phonetic words which present
their individual problems and must be individually mastered. It should
contain a very few of the most important spelling rules simply stated.
It should contain a large variety of sentences for dictation, which
may wisely take the form of gems of thought. Such a plan, well taught,
constantly supplemented by the teacher with such words as the peculiar
difficulties of individual pupils and classes may require, will produce a
maximum of ability to spell correctly.

In the Aldine Speller the authors have presented a plan of teaching
which in actual results has proved singularly effective. The vocabulary
has been selected and graded with unusual care to meet the actual needs
of life and to develop a spelling sense. In its preparation a careful
comparison was made of the vocabularies of several of the most popular
spelling books of the day in respect to both gradation and selection.
Paralleling this, the various recent tests and investigations, notably
those of Ayres, Jones, and Cook and O’Shea, have been checked. The
resulting vocabulary is thought to represent the real writing vocabulary
of the average child of the grade in which it is taught. Special and
repeated drills are given on the real trouble makers—the one hundred
and more words that comprise four-fifths of the misspelled words of the
schoolroom.

In the primary grades use is made of exceptionally valuable phonetic
lists. Emphasis is placed upon this important and very practical
foundation for the development of a spelling sense, and its mastery in
the primary grades will do much to train children to spell correctly. A
few comparatively uncommon words are used in these lists chiefly for the
value of the phonetic drill.

As every error creates a tendency, and if repeated quickly establishes
a habit, it is important that the correct spelling of words be taught
before children have occasion to write them. Every worth-while test and
investigation shows the most common and most useful words in our language
to be the words used early by children. It is likewise certain that very
many of the misspelled words are one-syllable words in very common use.
It would, therefore, seem essential that the real teaching of spelling
should be done as early as possible in the grades—somewhat earlier than
has frequently been the case—that correct habits, rather than incorrect
ones, may be formed.

Obligation is expressed to Dr. Leonard P. Ayres of the Russell Sage
Foundation for kind permission to make use of his list of “The Thousand
Commonest Words.” These and some four thousand other very common and
important words constitute the Aldine vocabulary.

That the Aldine Speller may lead to some real teaching, and decrease
“lesson hearing,” is the hope of the authors.




DIRECTIONS TO TEACHERS


ORAL SPELLING

Oral spelling should always precede written spelling in the primary
grades. Careful and distinct pronunciation by the child should always
precede oral spelling. Children cannot be expected to spell correctly
words that they cannot pronounce. It is well to emphasize the form of a
word of more than one syllable by syllabication. It makes the spelling
more obvious, promotes clear enunciation, and assists in creating a
correct mental picture of the word. The sight words in this book are so
syllabicated when first presented. A slight pause between the syllables
is usually sufficient in oral spelling. In writing the words they should
not be divided.


TESTING

The mere “hearing” of spelling lessons is happily a thing of the past in
most schools. However, teachers cannot be too strongly impressed with the
worthlessness of such exercises. The primary object is to instruct, not
to examine—to teach to spell correctly, not to find out how many words
may be spelled incorrectly. Review lessons should be given frequently,
and these are sufficient for test purposes. All other lessons should be
thoroughly taught with instruction the aim and object of the lesson.


INTEREST

It has been well said that “interest is nine-tenths of education.” This
is true in teaching spelling. Any means which will arouse interest in
mastering words is likely to be effective. So far as our forefathers
succeeded in securing results in this subject they did so by interest
in the old-fashioned “spelling-bee.” Spelling matches of various sorts
are desirable for creating interest. The review lists and special lists
will be found admirable for this purpose. It should be remembered,
however, that this is testing what is already learned and is not teaching
something new.


PUPILS’ LISTS

Each pupil has his own difficulties in spelling. Teach him to make
private lists of the words which he finds especially hard to spell and
have him use extra effort to conquer these trouble-makers. These may
be listed in the back of his textbook or in his individual note book.
Occasional lessons may be devoted entirely to this kind of exercise and
they should be individual and painstaking. Such words should be watched
for in the other written work and misspelling prevented rather than
corrected. Besides making the misspelled words the basis of a lesson
they may well be correctly and carefully written on the board with the
difficulty shown in colored crayon. If possible leave them in sight for
several days.


HOMOPHONES

Words spelled differently but pronounced alike should be kept apart until
the spelling of each has become fixed and the ability to use correctly
in sentences reasonably sure. Then only may they safely be brought
together for comparison. When this is done much care must be used that no
confusion may exist in the child’s mind as to the proper use of each.


ORDER OF PRESENTATION

All children do not learn spelling equally well in the same way. Some are
sense organ learners while others are largely motor organ learners. Most
children are both. In all cases the order of seeing words, hearing them
pronounced, pronouncing them, spelling them aloud, and then writing them,
will be found to be most effective. Appeal is thus made successively to
the eye, the ear, the memory, and the hand.


ENUNCIATION

Poor enunciation is a common source of incorrect spelling. Occasionally
test your pupils on sounding words. See to it that they learn to give
the right value to the vowel sounds and do not omit any that should be
sounded. Do not permit _in_ for _ing_, final _ed_ to be sounded like
_t_, or “body” to be sounded “buddy.” Remember that “A word correctly
pronounced is half spelled.”


PROPER NAMES

No place has been given in this book to proper names, since the needs
of different classrooms vary so widely. They must be thoroughly taught,
however, and it is the teacher’s duty to teach such proper names as her
pupils need to use. Strongly emphasize the fact that these proper names
always begin with a capital letter.


USING THE STORIES

Read the stories, “The Two Scouts” and “The Two Boys” with the pupils.
See that they understand the meaning and the object of telling these
stories. Keep them before the pupils by constant application to their
own efforts. If you wish, you may keep records of the work of the
scouts, giving the successful ones decorations—stars or crosses on the
blackboard, or on especially prepared charts.


CAREFUL TEACHING

In teaching every lesson, do your part by pronouncing every word clearly
and correctly; by requiring the children to do the same, paying especial
care to final _d_, _t_, and _ing_; by training the child really to see
the word, calling attention to silent letters, unusual combinations, and
applying the rules that are given in their books.


USE AND MEANING

Remember, it is not enough that children pronounce and spell words
correctly. They should know the meaning and how to use each word. To help
them to make the words in their book part of their vocabulary, certain
devices are used.

1. Many of the words are grouped in their natural connection—school
words, letter words, business and trade words, journey words, etc. A few
suggestions showing how these group words may be used are given in the
book. Oral work should always precede the written work. See Lesson 89,
Sixth Year, for illustration. See that the children’s sentences are well
expressed before allowing any writing. Perhaps it will not be necessary
to write at all. It _is_ necessary that every child should know how to
use and spell the words correctly.

2. When a word is taught, one or more of its common derivatives are
given,—a saving in study of the spelling lesson, and an added clearness
to meaning. For illustrations see Lessons 39 and 42.

3. Well-selected quotations from the best sources are given, showing the
words used correctly. Many of these quotations should be memorized; some
should be dictated; some are to be reproduced; some are to be copied,
substituting other words in place of underlined words; all are to be read
intelligently, that the pupils may learn the true meaning of the words by
meeting them in their right context.


SPELLING DEMONS

On pages 11 and 12 is a remarkable list of words frequently misspelled.
They are given here by permission of the compiler, Dr. W. F. Jones of
the University of South Dakota. He has happily named them the “One
Hundred Spelling Demons of the English Language.” As the result of a most
exhaustive and careful investigation he finds them to be not only the
most commonly misspelled words, but frequently and persistently to be
misspelled in all grades.

These words have been taught and frequently reviewed. Call the children’s
attention over and over again to the difficulties in them. Use some of
them daily. Hold the children to the correct spelling of them in all
written work. Make opportunities to use them. Keep a record in plain
sight, showing the children’s progress in conquering them. Make the
mastery of these words a matter personal to yourself, even to the extent
of considering your teaching a failure if every child in the fifth year
does not form the habit of correctly spelling this list. Call attention
to these pages at the beginning of the year, and arouse the children’s
interest and ambition to master the words as early as possible.

On page 49 is given another list of lesser “demons.” The sixth-grade
teacher should in like manner hold herself responsible for this list.
Keep on urging and testing until each child has mastered his particular
“word demons.”


REVIEW LISTS

On pages 27-28 and 65-66 are lists of words for review. These are
selected from “The One Thousand Commonest Words” as found by Dr.
Ayres, and are here used by permission. Without special study, at
least seventy-nine per cent of those given on pages 27-28 were spelled
correctly by the fifth-grade children in eighty-four cities in the United
States, and at least seventy-nine per cent of those given on pages 65-66
were spelled correctly by the sixth-grade children in the same schools.
Careful teaching should give a much higher percentage.


THE VOCABULARY

The vocabulary, alphabetically arranged for each year, will be found
on pages 29 and 67. Encourage the children to use this vocabulary to
check up the words that they are positive they can spell correctly, and
for reference in finding any word they may wish to use in their written
work. These lists of words may also be used for oral spelling matches or
written reviews.


SUMMARY

To sum up: Arouse a spelling interest; develop a spelling sense; teach
the children how to study intelligently; review constantly; keep definite
records of progress; find each child’s “word demons” and master them; do
thoughtful teaching.




TO THE GIRLS AND BOYS:


THE TWO SCOUTS

Once upon a time the general of an army found himself in a serious
position. He was shut up in a fortified town and his food supply was very
low. In order to find out something of the position, strength, and plans
of the enemy, he sent two young soldiers out as scouts.

After many hardships the scouts came within sight of the enemy’s lines.
While they were looking down on the hostile camp from the top of a high
tree, two officers came riding toward them. When they reached the tree
in which the frightened scouts were hidden, the officers stopped to rest
their horses in the shade. Never dreaming that their conversation could
be overheard, they discussed their plans freely and rode away. As soon as
it was safe, the two scouts came to the ground.

“What a lucky escape!” said one. “We might both have been captured. This
teaches us a lesson. We will separate. Then if one is captured, the other
can carry our information to the general.”

So they separated, and in due time one of the scouts came into the
general’s presence.

“Well,” said the general, “how many men have the enemy?”

“Ever and ever so many,” answered the scout.

“Cavalry? Artillery? What?” asked the general sharply.

“Both,” replied the scout.

“Where are they?” asked the general.

“On the other side of the wood,” said the scout.

“But can’t you give me a better idea of their number and position?” cried
the impatient officer.

“I only know that there are ever and ever so many of them, and that they
are scattered all over the countryside,” was the answer.

“Well, did you learn anything of their plans?” asked the almost
discouraged general.

“Yes,” answered the scout eagerly. “I heard two officers talking. They
are going to besiege us, attack Clifton, and wait for reënforcements.”

“But what are they going to do first?” asked the anxious general.

“I don’t remember,” was the answer.

“I know no more than I did before you started! To think of the chance you
have lost!” exclaimed the officer.

Just then the second scout entered.

“What have you to report?” asked the general.

The young man drew a piece of paper toward him and by a rough sketch and
a few words of explanation, showed the general the position and number
of the enemy, so that he saw at a glance their strength and weakness.
Then he added: “The officers that discussed their plans under our tree
say that they will wait for reënforcements. Then part of their army will
besiege us closely, keeping us busy, while the main army will capture
Clifton.”

“You have saved our army!” cried the delighted general. “From to-day you
are ranked as captain. We will break through their lines before their
reënforcements come up, and march to the relief of Clifton!”

Then turning to the first scout, he said: “You saw and heard exactly the
same things as this young man, but instead of bringing me news worth
while, you brought only a confused report. Do you know why you failed and
he succeeded?”

“Yes,” was the answer, “he’s a born scout. I’m not.”

“Nonsense!” replied the general. “He has trained himself to _see
exactly_, to _hear exactly_, and to _repeat exactly_. That’s all that is
needed to make a born scout.”


THE TWO BOYS

Two boys were set to study the same spelling lesson. When it was time to
write the lesson, one boy knew that a certain word “had an _i_ and an _e_
in it,” but he could not tell which came first, so he guessed and failed.
When the teacher pronounced another word, he wasn’t just sure what she
did say, so again he guessed and again he failed. When called upon to
read the words in the lesson, he left off final letters and slurred other
letters, so that he did not even pronounce the words correctly, and as a
perfectly pronounced word is half spelled, he failed once more. The other
boy had a perfect paper.

The teacher said: “You boys had the same list of words to study, and the
same time in which to master them. You had the same chance to hear them
pronounced correctly and to pronounce them yourselves. Yet John has a
perfect paper, and Tom has a failure. Do you know why?”

“John is a natural-born speller,” answered Tom. “I am not.”

“Nonsense!” replied the teacher. “John has trained himself to _see
exactly_, to make a good mind picture of the word, just as the successful
scout did of the enemy’s lines, and so with his pencil he can reproduce
it exactly. He, like the same scout, has trained his ear to _hear
exactly_, and his mind to _reproduce exactly_. That’s all that is needed
to make a born speller.”

Which scout did Tom most resemble? Which would you rather be like?

Are you a “natural-born speller,” that is, do you

    _See exactly,_
    _Hear exactly,_
    _Pronounce exactly?_

Long ago brave knights rode about seeking and overcoming all dragons
and demons that brought trouble to mankind. Today there are still many
difficulties to be sought out and overcome. Some spelling words cause so
much trouble that they have been called “Spelling Demons.” You will find
one hundred of these on this and the following page. Have you already
overcome them all? If not, _do it now_.

THE WOLF AND THE SHEEP

A wolf that had been bitten by a dog, lay under a hedge unable to move. A
sheep wandered by and the wolf summoned her to his relief.

“I am perishing. Please bring me some water from your trough,” he begged.
“If you will supply me with water, I will provide my own meat.”

The frightened sheep retreated rapidly, saying, “I see through your
scheme, you brutal rogue. I know how you will secure your meat. If I come
near enough to give you a drink, you will make mincemeat of me.”—ÆSOP.

A professor in a certain college liked to confuse the students by asking
unexpected questions. One very cold night he asked a bright student how
many stars are in the sky.

“Wait, professor, and I will tell you,” replied the student, and
commenced to count very slowly. When he had reached two hundred, the
professor, who was half frozen, exclaimed hoarsely, “That will do! I
admit that you are a wonderful student. Your method is slow and the
results will doubtless be accurate, but I will detain you no longer.”

                                                            Dec. 14, 1809.

Dear Father:

I received your letter and to prove to you how important I regard the
rules you gave me, I am following your advice by writing to you at once.
First I will proceed to describe to you the arrangement of my desk as you
say it is most necessary to attend to this before attempting to write. My
desk is tidy. The articles on it are arranged neatly. You can see from
this letter that I have obeyed your rules for writing. I have used the
eraser when necessary. There are no blots. Finally I think the writing is
neat and there are no misspelled words.

Does this satisfy you, Father? If so remember our bargain and bring me
the violin on your return. Come soon for I am lonesome without you.

I go skating every day. Of course I am not yet a skillful skater, but I
am slowly improving.

I shall be careful in addressing the envelope to use capitals and to
place a period after every initial. I want my letter within and without
to satisfy you.

                            Your obedient son,

                                                                     JOHN.

This letter, almost exactly as given in your book, was written by a boy
of long ago in answer to a letter from his father.

What rules did his father give him about his desk? Using the eraser?
Blots? Spelling?

What bargain did he make with his son?

Write a letter like the one you think John’s father sent to him.

_The Cock and the Diamond_

[Illustration]

A cock scratching in a barren field found a diamond buried in the soil.

The curious hens attracted by the sparkling jewel gathered eagerly around
him. The cock was plainly disappointed.

“How lovely!” exclaimed an old hen. “Do you realize that you have found a
diamond? Are you aware that diamonds are very costly?”

“I don’t care how costly this jewel may be,” answered the sensible cock.
“Although it may be the biggest diamond in the world I’ll gladly exchange
it for a kernel of corn, a nut, or a fat beetle.”—ÆSOP.

THE STAR-SPANGLED BANNER

    O say, can you see, by the dawn’s early light,
    What so proudly we hailed at the twilight’s last gleaming?
    Whose broad stripes and bright stars, through the perilous fight,
    O’er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?
    And the rockets’ red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
    Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there;
    O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave
    O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave?

                                                  —FRANCIS SCOTT KEY.

CEREMONY OF THE NATIONAL FLAG

_In order to show the proper respect to the flag the following ceremony
should be observed_:

    It should not be hoisted before sunrise nor allowed to remain
    up after sunset.

    At “retreat,” sunset, civilian spectators should stand
    at “attention” and uncover during the playing of the
    “Star-Spangled Banner.” Military spectators are required by
    regulation to stand at attention and give the military salute.

    When the National colors are passing on parade, or in review,
    the spectator should, if walking, halt, and if sitting, arise,
    and stand at attention and uncover.

    When the flag is flown at half staff as a sign of mourning
    it should be hoisted to full staff at the conclusion of the
    funeral.

    In placing the flag at half staff, it should first be hoisted
    to the top of the staff and then lowered to position, and
    before lowering from half staff it should be first raised to
    the top.

    On Memorial Day the flag should fly at half staff from sunrise
    to noon, and full staff from noon to sunset.—SONS OF THE
    REVOLUTION IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

Read the above rules for showing respect to the flag, then close your
book and write them from memory using your own words.

The president’s salute and the British royal salute are the
same—twenty-one guns. There are various opinions as to the origin of
this number. Some claim that the original number was seven and that
twenty-one was adopted to represent the union of England, Scotland, and
Ireland—seven guns for each country.

THE CALF AND THE OX

    A calf that had never felt the yoke, _mocked_ an ox who was
    _attached_ to a plow for _submitting_ to such _drudgery_. The
    ox was _annoyed_ but _continued_ his work.

    Not long after there was a great _festival_. The ox had his
    _annual_ holiday for this _event_, but the calf was sacrificed
    on the altar.

    “If that is the end of idleness,” _declared_ the ox, “I think
    work is better. I had rather my neck felt the yoke forever than
    the ax for a moment.”—ÆSOP.

Rewrite the above fable using other words in the place of those that are
italicized.

The plural of nouns is generally formed by adding _s_ to the singular.
You have learned that some nouns ending in _f_ change the _f_ to _v_
and add _es_. You have also learned that nouns ending in _y_ preceded
by a consonant change _y_ to _i_ and add _es_. Some nouns ending in _o_
preceded by a consonant form the plural by adding _es_.

Write the plural of the following.

    he ro
    cal i co
    car go

In every one of the above words you will find either the letters _ei_ or
_ie_. In every word these two letters are pronounced _e_. How can you
know when to use _ie_ and when to use _ei_? There is a very easy way to
remember. Look at the word _Alice_. What letter comes after _l_? In using
_ie_ or _ei_, _i_ always follows _l_ just as it does in _Alice_. What
letter in _Alice_ follows _c_? In using _ie_ or _ei_, _e_ always follows
_c_ just as it does in _Alice_. Look at the words in Lesson 45 and 46
and see if this is not so. Whenever you have occasion to use any word
containing these letters, remember the word _Alice_. That is the keyword.

Another easy rule applies to _ie_ in other words. Be sure to remember it.

    “_I_ before _e_
    Except after _c_
    Or when sounded as _a_
    As in _neighbor_ or _weigh_.”

In the previous grade you learned that there are one hundred words that
are so frequently misspelled that they have been named the “One Hundred
Spelling Demons.” Review that list of “Demons” on pages 11 and 12.

On this page and the next are given one hundred more “Demons.” They are
very common words that are frequently misspelled. Have you studied them
carefully enough so that you can always spell them correctly?

The words in Lessons 73-88 may be used to describe an ocean voyage.
Lesson 73 contains words that suggest the picture of going _aboard_
the _steamer_ for an _ocean voyage_ to _foreign_ lands. Lesson 74
contains words that suggest the farewell to folks ashore; Lessons 76-77,
seasickness; Lesson 78, the joy at being well again, etc.

Choose a lesson and write a short description of the picture the words
suggest to you—one sentence will do if you can get all the words into
it, as, Lesson 83—Everyone was asked to _subscribe_ to the _fund_ for
_sailors’ widows_ and _orphans_.

The king was of middle stature, well proportioned and hardy, and active
from athletic exercises. His carriage was free, erect, and majestic. He
had a clear, serene forehead, which appeared more lofty from his head
being partly bald. His eyebrows were large;—his eyes were clear and
animated; his complexion was somewhat ruddy, and scorched by the toils
of war; his mouth moderate, well formed and gracious in expression; his
teeth white though small and irregular; his speech quick and fluent. He
was simple in dress and diet, and devout in his religion.—WASHINGTON

RULES OF BEHAVIOR

Every action in company ought to be with some sign of respect to those
present.

Think before you speak, pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring your words
too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

Associate yourself with men of good quality, if you esteem your own
reputation; for it is better to be alone than in bad company.—GEORGE
WASHINGTON.

*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE ALDINE SPELLER, PART THREE ***


    

Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.


START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™
electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at www.gutenberg.org. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:

    • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    
    • You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
