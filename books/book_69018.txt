                                PREFACE


The Introduction, by which the present work is ushered into public
notice, renders any lengthened Preface on my part quite unnecessary.
Yet I wish to say a few words with regard to the design and plan of
this little volume.

The subject, though no doubt possessing a peculiar interest to the
general reader, and especially to tourists in these travelling
days, falls naturally under the head of historical and geographical
instruction in schools; and for such use the book is, in the first
place, specially intended.

When I was myself one of a class in this city where Geography and
History were taught, no information connected with etymology was
imparted to us. We learned, with more or less trouble and edification,
the names of countries, towns, etc., by rote; but our teacher did not
ask us who gave the names to these places, nor were we expected to
inquire or to know if there was any connection between their names
and their histories. Things are changed now; and I believe the first
stimulus to an awakening interest in Geographical Etymology was given
by the publication of the Rev. Isaac Taylor’s popular work, _Words
and Places_. About ten years ago, I found that the best teachers in
the English schools of Edinburgh did ask questions on this subject,
and I discovered, at the same time, that a book specially bearing
upon it was a desideratum in school literature. As no one better
qualified came forward, I was induced to make the attempt; and I hope
the following pages, the result of much research and in the face of no
small discouragement, may prove useful to teachers, as well as to their
pupils.

The Index at the end of the volume, although it contains many names not
included in the body of the work, does by no means include all that I
have given there. This did not seem necessary, because, the root words
being alphabetically arranged, an intelligent teacher or pupil will
easily find the key to the explanation of any special name by referring
to the head under which it is naturally classed. I must, however,
premise that, with regard to names derived from the Celtic languages,
the root word is generally placed at the beginning of the name--that
is, if it contain more than one syllable. This is the case with such
vocables as _pen_, _ben_, _dun_, _lis_, _rath_, _strath_, etc.; _e.g._
Lismore, Benmore, Dungarvan, Strath-Allan. On the other hand, in names
derived from the Teutonic or Scandinavian languages, the root word
comes last, as will be found with regard to _ton_, _dale_, _burg_,
_berg_, _stadt_, _dorf_, _ford_, etc.

The index, therefore, may be expected to include principally such names
as, either through corruption or abbreviation, have materially changed
their form, such as are formed from the simple root, like Fürth, Ennis,
Delft, or such as contain more than one, as in Portrush, it being
uncertain under which head I may have placed such names. Along with the
root words, called by the Germans _Grundwörter_, I have given a number
of defining words (_Bestimmungswörter_)--such adjectives as express
variety in colour, form, size, etc.

It is to be regretted that many names have necessarily been omitted
from ignorance or uncertainty with regard to their derivation. This
is the case, unfortunately, with several well-known and important
towns--Glasgow, Berlin, Berne, Madrid, Paisley, etc. With regard to
these and many others, I shall be glad to receive reliable information.

And now it only remains for me to express my obligations to the
gentlemen who have kindly assisted me in this work, premising that,
in the departments which they have revised, the credit of success is
due mainly to them; while I reserve to myself any blame which may be
deservedly attached to failures or omissions. The Celtic portion of
my proof-sheets has been revised by Dr. Skene, the well-known Celtic
scholar of this city, and by Dr. Joyce, author of _Irish Names of
Places_. I have also to thank the Rev. Isaac Taylor, author of _Words
and Places_, for the help and encouragement which he has given me
from time to time; and Mr. Paterson, author of the _Magyars_, for
valuable information which I received from him regarding the topography
of Hungary. I appreciate the assistance given me by these gentlemen
the more, that it did not proceed from personal friendship, as I was
an entire stranger to all of them. It was the kindness and courtesy
of the stronger and more learned to one weaker and less gifted than
themselves; and I beg they may receive my grateful thanks, along with
the little volume which has been so much their debtor.

                             INTRODUCTION


Among the branches of human speculation that, in recent times, have
walked out of the misty realm of conjecture into the firm land of
science, and from the silent chamber of the student into the breezy
fields of public life, there are few more interesting than Etymology.
For as words are the common counters, or coins rather, with which we
mark our points in all the business and all the sport of life, any man
whose curiosity has not been blunted by familiarity, will naturally
find a pleasure in understanding what the image and superscription on
these markers mean; and amongst words there are none that so powerfully
stimulate this curiosity as the names of persons and places. About
these the intelligent interest of young persons is often prominently
manifested; and it is a sad thing when parents or teachers, who should
be in a position to gratify this interest, are obliged to waive an
eager intelligence aside, and by repeated negations to repel the
curiosity which they ought to have encouraged. Geography indeed,
a subject full of interest to the young mind, has too often been
taught in such a way as neither to delight the imagination with vivid
pictures, nor to stimulate inquiry by a frequent reference to the
history of names; and this is an evil which, if found to a certain
extent in all countries, is particularly rank in Great Britain, where
the language of the country is composed of fragments of half a dozen
languages, which only the learned understand, and which, to the ear of
the many, have no more significance than if they were Hebrew or Coptic.
The composite structure of our English speech, in fact, tends to
conceal from us the natural organism of language; so that in our case,
it requires a special training to make us fully aware of the great
truth announced by Horne Tooke, that “in language there is nothing
arbitrary.” Nevertheless, the curiosity about the meaning of words,
though seldom cherished, is not easily extinguished; and, in this age
of locomotion, there are few scraps of information more grateful to
the intelligent tourist than those which relate to the significance of
topographical names. When, for instance, the London holiday-maker, in
his trip to the West Highlands, setting foot in one of Mr. Hutchinson’s
steamboats at Oban, on his way to the historic horrors of Glencoe,
finds on his larboard side a long, low island, green and treeless,
called _Lismore_, he will be pleased, no doubt, at first by simply
hearing so euphonious a word in a language that he had been taught
to believe was harsh and barbarous, but will be transported into an
altogether different region of intelligent delight when he is made to
understand that this island is wholly composed of a vein of limestone,
found only here in the midst of a wide granitic region skirted with
trap; that, by virtue of this limestone, the island, though treeless,
is more fertile than the surrounding districts; and that for this
reason it has received the Celtic designation of _Liosmor_, or the
_great garden_. Connected with this etymology, not only is the
topographical name made to speak reasonably to a reasonable being, but
it contains in its bosom a geological fact, and an œconomical issue,
bound together by a bond of association the most natural and the most
permanent. The pleasant nature of the intelligence thus awakened leads
us naturally to lament that, except to those who are born in Celtic
districts and speak the Celtic language, the significance of so many of
our most common topographical names in the most interesting districts
is practically lost; and it deserves consideration whether, in our
English and classical schools, so much at least of the original speech
of the country should not be taught as would enable the intelligent
student to know the meaning of the local names, to whose parrot-like
repetition he must otherwise be condemned.

Some of the Celtic words habitually used in the designation of
places--such as _Ben_, _Glen_, _Strath_, and _Loch_--have been
incorporated into the common English tongue; and the addition to this
stock is not very large, which would enable an intelligent traveller
to hang the points of his picturesque tour on a philological peg
that would most materially insure both their distinctness and their
permanence. Nay, more; the germ of appreciation thus begotten might
lead a sympathetic nature easily into some more serious occupation with
the old language of our country; and this might lead to a discovery
full of pleasant surprise, that in the domain of words, as of physical
growth, the brown moors, when examined, often produce flowers of the
most choice beauty with which the flush of the most cultivated gardens
cannot compete, and that a venerable branch of the old Indo-European
family of languages, generally ignored as rude and unlettered, is rich
in a popular poetry, as fervid in passion, and as healthy in hue, as
anything that Homer or Hesiod ever sang.

In the realm of etymology, as everybody now knows, before Bopp
and Grimm, and other great scholars, laid the sure foundation of
comparative philology on the principles of a philosophy, as all
true philosophy is, at once inductive and deductive, the license of
conjecture played a mad part--a part, it is only too evident, not yet
fully played out--and specially raised such a glamour of illusion
about topographical etymology, that the theme became disgusting to all
sober-minded thinkers, or ludicrous, as the humour might be. We must,
therefore, approach this subject with a more than common degree of
caution, anxious rather to be instructed in what is solid, than to be
amazed with what is ingenious. It shall be our endeavour to proceed
step by step in this matter--patiently, as with the knowledge that our
foot is on the brink of boggy ground, starting from obvious principles
given by the constitution of the human mind, and confirmed by a large
induction of unquestioned facts.

The most natural and obvious reason for naming a place so-and-so
would be to express the nature of the situation by its most striking
features, with the double view of impressing its character on the
memory, and conveying to persons who had not seen it an idea of its
peculiarity; _i.e._ the most obvious and natural topographical names
are such as contain condensed descriptions or rude verbal pictures of
the object. Thus the notion of the highest mountain in a district may
be broadly conveyed by simply calling it the _big mount_, or, according
to the order of words current in the Celtic languages, _mount big_;
which is exactly what we find in BENMORE, from _mor_, big, the name
of several of the highest mountains in the Highlands of Scotland,
specially of one in the south of Perthshire, near Killin, of another
in Mull, the highest trap mountain in Scotland, and a third in Assynt.
Again, to mark the very prominent feature of mountains elevated
considerably above the normal height, that they are covered with snow
all the year round, we find LEBANON, in the north of Palestine, named
from the Hebrew _leban_, white; MONT BLANC, in Switzerland, in the same
way from an old Teutonic word signifying the same thing, which found
its way into Italian and the other Romanesque languages, fairly ousting
the Latin _albus_; OLYMPUS, from the Greek λάμπομαι, to shine; the
SCHNEEKOPPE, in Silesia, from _schnee_, snow, and _koppe_, what we call
_kip_ in the Lowland topography of Scotland, _i.e._ a pointed hill, the
same radically as the Latin _caput_, the head. In the same fashion one
of the modern names of the ancient Mount Hermon is _Jebel-eth-Thelj_,
the snowy mountain, just as the Himalayas receive their names from the
Sanscrit _haima_ = Greek χεîμα, winter.

The most obvious characteristic of any place, whether mountain or plain
or valley, would be its shape and size, its relative situation high or
low, behind or in the front, its colour, the kind of rock or soil of
which it is composed, the climate which it enjoys, the vegetation in
which it abounds, and the animals by which it is frequented. Let us
take a few familiar examples of each of these cases; and, if we deal
more largely in illustrations from the Scottish Highlands than from
other parts of the world, it is for three sufficient reasons--because
these regions are annually visited by the greatest number of tourists;
because, from the general neglect of the Celtic languages, they stand
most in need of interpretation; and because they are most familiar--not
from book-knowledge only, but by actual inspection--to the present
writer. In the matter of size, the tourist will find at GLENELG (from
_sealg_, to hunt), in Inverness-shire, opposite Skye, where there are
two well-preserved circular forts, the twin designations of GLENMORE
and GLENBEG; that is, Glenbig and Glenlittle--a contrast constantly
occurring in the Highlands; the word _beag_, pronounced vulgarly in
Argyleshire _peek_, signifying little, evidently the same as μικ in
the Greek μικρός. As to relative situation, the root _ard_, in Latin
_arduus_, frequently occurs; not, however, to express any very high
mountain, but either a bluff fronting the sea, as in ARDNAMORCHUAN
(the rise of the great ocean, _cuan_, perhaps from ὼκεανός), or more
frequently a slight elevation on the shore of a lake, what they call
in England a _rise_, as in ARDLUI, near the head of Loch Lomond,
ARDVOIRLICH, and many others. The word _lui_, Gaelic _laogh_--the _gh_
being silent, as in the English _sigh_--signifies a calf or a fawn, and
gives name to the lofty mountain which the tourist sees on his right
hand as he winds up where the railway is now being constructed from
Dalmally to Tyndrum. Another frequent root to mark relative situation
is CUL, _behind_, Latin _culus_, French _cul_, a word which gives
name to a whole parish in Aberdeenshire, to the famous historical
site of Culross, the reputed birthplace of St. Kentigern, and many
others. This word means simply _behind the headland_, as does also
CULCHENZIE (from _ceann_, the head), at the entrance to Loch Leven and
Glencoe, which the tourist looks on with interest, as for two years
the summer residence of the noble-minded Celtic evangelist Dr. Norman
Macleod. But the most common root, marking relative situation, which
the wanderer through Celtic countries encounters is _inver_, meaning
below, or the bottom of a stream, of which _aber_ is only a syncopated
form, a variation which, small as it appears, has given rise to large
controversy and no small shedding of ink among bellicose antiquarians.
For it required only a superficial glance to observe that while _Abers_
are scattered freely over Wales, they appear scantly in Scotland, and
there with special prevalence only in the east and south-east of the
Grampians--as in ABERDEEN, ABERDOUR, ABERLEMNO in Fife, and others. On
this the eager genius of archæological discovery, ever ready to poise
a pyramid on its apex, forthwith raised the theory, that the district
of Scotland where the _Abers_ prevailed had been originally peopled by
Celts of the Cymric or Welsh type, while the region of _Invers_ marked
out the ancient seats of the pure Caledonian Celts. But this theory,
which gave great offence to some fervid Highlanders, so far as it stood
on this argument, fell to the ground the moment that some more cool
observer put his finger on half a dozen or a whole dozen of Invers, in
perfect agreement hobnobbing with the Abers, not far south of Aberdeen;
while, on the other hand, a zealous Highland colonel, now departed to a
more peaceful sphere, pointed out several Abers straggling far west and
north-west into the region of the Caledonian Canal and beyond it. But
these slippery points are wisely avoided; and there can be no doubt, on
the general principle, that relative situation has everywhere played
a prominent part in the terminology of districts. Northumberland and
Sutherland, and Cape DEAS or Cape South, in Cantire, are familiar
illustrations of this principle of nomenclature. In such cases the
name, of course, always indicates by what parties it was imposed;
Sutherland, or Southern-land, having received this appellation from the
Orkney men, who lived to the north of the Pentland Firth.

The next element that claims mention is Colour. In this domain the most
striking contrasts are black and white. In ancient Greece, a common
name for rivers was MELAS, or Black-water; one of which, that which
flows into the Malaic Gulf, has translated itself into modern Greek
as MAURO-NERO, μαûρο in the popular dialect having supplanted the
classical μἐλας; and νἐρο, as old, no doubt, as Nereus and the Nereids,
having come into its pre-Homeric rights and driven out the usurping
ὕδωρ. In the Scottish Highlands, _dubh_, _black_ or _dark_, plays, as
might be expected, a great figure in topographical nomenclature; of
this let BENMUIC DUBH, or the _mount of the black sow_, familiar to
many a Braemar deer-stalker, serve as an example; while CAIRNGORM,
the cradle of many a golden-gleaming gem, stands with its dark blue
(_gorm_) cap immediately opposite, and recalls to the classical fancy
its etymological congeners in the CYANEAN rocks, so famous in early
Greek fable. Of the contrasted epithet _white_, LEUCADIA (λευκός),
where the poetess Sappho is famed to have made her erotic leap, is a
familiar example. In the Highlands, _ban_ (fair), or _geal_ (white), is
much less familiar in topographical nomenclature than _dubh_; BUIDHE,
on the other hand (yellow), corresponding to the ξανθός of the Greeks,
is extremely common, as in LOCHBUIE at the south-east corner of Mull,
one of the few remaining scattered links of the possessions of the
Macleans, once so mighty and latterly so foolish, in those parts. Among
other colours, _glas_ (gray) is very common; so is _dearg_ (red), from
the colour of the rock, as in one of those splendid peaks that shoot
up behind the slate quarries at the west end of Glencoe. _Breac_, also
(spotted or brindled), is by no means uncommon, as in BEN VRACKIE,
prominent behind Pitlochrie, in Perthshire, in which word the initial
_b_ has been softened into a _v_ by the law of aspiration peculiar to
the Celtic languages.

There remain the two points of climate and vegetation, of which a
few examples will suffice. In Sicily, the town of SELINUS, whose
magnificence remains preserved in indelible traces upon the soil,
took its name from the wild parsley, σἐλινον, which grew plentifully
on the ground, and which appears on the coins of the city. In the
Scottish Highlands, no local name is more common than that which is
familiarly known as the designation of one of the most genuine of the
old Celtic chiefs, the head of the clan Macpherson--we mean the word
CLUNY (Gaelic _cluain_; possibly only a variety of _grün_, green),
which signifies simply a green meadow, a vision often very delightful
to a pedestrian after a long day’s tramp across brown brae and gray
fell in those parts. The abundance of oak in ancient Celtic regions,
where it is not so common now, is indicated by the frequency of the
termination _darach_ (from which DERRY, in Ireland, is corrupted;
Greek δρûς and δόρυ, as in the designation of one of the Campbells in
Argyle, AUCHIN-DARROCH, _i.e._ oak-field. The pine, _giubhas_, appears
in KINGUSSIE, pine-end, in the midst of that breezy open space which
spreads out to the north-west of the Braemar Grampians. In BEITH and
AULTBEA (birch-brook) we have _beath_, Latin _betula_, a birch-tree;
elm and ash are rare; heather, _fraoch_, especially in the designation
of islands, as EILEANFRAOCH, in Loch Awe, and another in the Sound
of Kerrera, close by Oban. Of climate we find traces in AUCHNASHEEN
(_sian_), on the open blasty road between Dingwall and Janetown,
signifying the field of wind and rain; in MEALFOURVONIE, the broad
hill of the frosty moor, composed of the three roots _maol_ (broad and
bald), _fuar_ (cold), and _mhonaid_ (upland); in BALFOUR (cold town),
and in the remarkable mountain in Assynt called CANISP, which appears
to be a corruption of _Ceann-uisge_, or Rainy-head.

Lastly, of animals: _madadh_, a fox, appears in LOCHMADDY and ARDMADDY;
_coin_, of a dog, in ACHNACHOIN, or Dog’s-field, one of the three
bloody spots that mark the butchery of the false Campbell in Glencoe;
and, throwing our glance back two thousand years, in CYNOSCEPHALÆ, or
the Dog’s-head, in Thessaly, where the sturdy Macedonian power at last
bowed in submission before the proud swoop of the Roman eagles; the
familiar cow (_baa_, Lat. _bos_) gives its name to that fair loch,
which sleeps so quietly in the bosom of beautiful Mull; while the goat,
famous also in the sad history of Athenian decline at AIGOSPOTAMI,
or the Goat’s-river, gives its name to the steepy heights of ARDGOUR
(from _gobhar_, Lat. _caper_), a fragment of the old inheritance of
the Macleans, which rise up before the traveller so majestically as he
steams northward from Ballachulish to Fort William and Banavie.

In a country composed almost entirely of mountain ridges, with
intervening hollows of various kinds, it is only natural that the
variety in the scenery, produced by the various slopes and aspects of
the elevated ground, should give rise to a descriptive nomenclature of
corresponding variety. This is especially remarkable in Gaelic; and the
tourist in the Scottish Highlands will not travel far without meeting,
in addition to the _Ben_ and _Ard_ already mentioned, the
following specific designations:--

    _Drum_--a ridge.
    _Scour_--a jagged ridge or peak.
    _Cruach_--a conical mountain.
    _Mam_--a slowly rising hill.
    _Maol_--a broad, flat, bald mountain.
    _Monagh_--an upland moor.
    _Tulloch_ or _Tilly_--a little hill, a knoll.
    _Tom_--a hillock, a mound.
    _Tor_--a hillock, a mound.
    _Bruach_--a steep slope (Scotch brae).
    _Craig_--crag, cliff.
    _Cairn_--a heap of stones.
    _Lairg_--a broad, low slope.
    _Letter_--the side of a hill near the water.
    _Croit_--a hump.
    _Clach_--a stone.
    _Lech_--a flagstone.

In the Lowlands, _pen_, _law_, _fell_, _bræ_, _hope_, _rise_, _edge_,
indicate similar varieties. Among these _pen_, as distinguished from
the northern _ben_, evidently points to a Welsh original. _Hope_ is a
curious word, which a south-country gentleman once defined to me as
“the point of the low land mounting the hill whence the top can be
seen.” Of course, if this be true, it means an elevation not very far
removed from the level ground, because, as every hill-climber knows,
the top of a huge eminence ceases to be visible the moment you get
beyond what the Greeks call the “fore-feet” of the mountain.

In the designation of the intervening hollows, or low land, the variety
of expression is naturally less striking. _Glen_ serves for almost all
varieties of a narrow Highland valley. A very narrow rent or fissured
gorge is called a _glachd_. The English word _dale_, in Gaelic _dail_,
means in that language simply a field, or flat stretch of land at the
bottom of the hills. It is to be noted, however, that this word is both
Celtic and Teutonic; but, in topographical etymology, with a difference
distinctly indicative of a twofold origin. In an inland locality where
the Scandinavians never penetrated, _Dal_ is always prefixed to the
other element of the designation, as in DALWHINNIE, DALNACARDOCH, and
DALNASPIDAL, the field of meeting, the field of the smithy, and the
field of the hospital, all in succession within a short distance on
the road between the Spey uplands and Blair Athol. On the other hand,
a postfixed _dale_, as in BORROWDALE, EASDALE, and not a few others,
indicates a Saxon or Norse origin. The word _den_ or _dean_, as in the
DEAN BRIDGE, Edinburgh, and the DEN BURN, Aberdeen, is Anglo-Saxon
_denn_, and appears in the English TENTERDEN, and some others. Another
Celtic name for field is _ach_, the Latin _ag-er_, which appears in
a number of Highland places, as in ACH-NA-CLOICHE (stone field),
in Argyleshire. A hollow surrounded by mountains is called by the
well-known name of LAGGAN, which is properly a diminutive from _lag_,
in Greek λάκκος, in Latin _lacus_, a hollow filled with water, and
in German a mere _loch_, or hole, into which a mouse might creep. A
special kind of hollow, lying between the outstretched arms of a big
Ben, and opening at one end into the vale below, is called in Gaelic
_coire_, literally a cauldron--a word which the genius of Walter Scott
has made a permanent possession of the English language. In England
such mountain hollows are often denominated _combs_, as in ADDISCOMBE,
ASHCOMB, a venerable old British word of uncorrupted Cornish descent,
and which, so far as I know, does not appear in Scottish topography,
unless it be in CUMMERTREES (on the shore, _traigh_), near Annan, and
CUMBERNAULD; but this I am not able to verify by local knowledge. The
word _cumar_ appears in O’Reilly’s Irish dictionary as “the bed of
a large river or a narrow sea, a hollow generally,” but seems quite
obsolete in the spoken Gaelic of to-day. The termination _holm_ is
well-known both in English and Scotch names, and proclaims itself as
characteristically Scandinavian, in the beautiful metropolis of the
Swedes. In Gaelic districts a holm, that is, a low watery meadow, is
generally called a _lon_, a word which has retained its place in Scotch
as _loan_--LOANING, LOANHEAD, LOANEND, and is fundamentally identical
with the English _lane_ and _lawn_. The varieties of sea-coast are
expressed by the words _traigh_, _cladach_, _camus_, _corran_, _wick_,
_loch_, _rutha_, _ross_, _caolas_, _stron_, _salen_, among which, in
passing, we may specially note _camus_, from the root _cam_, Greek
κάμπτω, to bend: hence MORECAMBE BAY, near Lancaster, signifies the
great bend; _corran_, a scythe, evidently allied to the Latin _curvus_,
and used in the Highlands to denote any crescent-shaped shore, as at
Corranferry, Ardgour, in Lochfinne; _wick_, a familiar Scandinavian
word signifying a bay, and which, with the Gaelic article prefixed,
seems to have blundered itself into NIGG at Aberdeen, and near Fearn
in Ross-shire; _caolas_, a strait, combining etymologically the very
distant and very different localities of CALAIS and BALLACHULISH;
_stron_ or _sron_, a nose, which lends its name to a parish near the
end of Loch Sunart, in Morvern, and thence to a famous mineral found in
its vicinity; lastly, _salen_ is nothing but salt, and appears in the
south of Ireland and the north-west of Scotland, under the slightly
varied forms of KINSALE and KINTAIL, both of which words signify the
head of the salt water; for Irish and Gaelic are only one language
with a slightly different spelling here and there, and a sprinkling of
peculiar words now and then.

The only other features of natural scenery that play a noticeable
part in topographical etymology are the rivers, lakes, wells, and
waterfalls; and they need not detain us long. The Gaelic _uisge_,
water, of which the Latin _aqua_ is an abraded form, appears in the
names of Scottish rivers as _Esk_, and of Welsh rivers as _Usc_. The
familiar English Avon is the Gaelic _amhainn_, evidently softened down
by aspiration from the Latin _amnis_. This _avon_ often appears at the
end of river names curtailed, as in GARONNE, the rough river, from the
Gaelic root _garbh_, rough. The DON, so common as a river name from the
Black Sea to Aberdeen, means either the deep river or the brown river.
A small river, _brook_ in English, gives name to not a few places and
persons. In the Scottish Highlands, and in those parts of the Lowlands
originally inhabited by the Celtic race, the word _alt_ performs the
same functions. _Loch_, in Gaelic, answering to the English _mere_
(Latin _mare_), appears most commonly in the Highlands, as KINLOCH,
_i.e._ the town or house at the head of the lake; and _tobar_, a
well, frequently, as in HOLYWELL, connected with a certain religious
sanctity, appears in TOBERMORY, _i.e._ the well of the Virgin Mary, one
of the most beautiful quiet bits of bay scenery in Great Britain. Of
places named from waterfalls (_eas_, from _esk_), a significant element
in Highland scenery, INVERNESS, and MONESS near Aberfeldy, are the most
notable, the one signifying “the town at the bottom of the river, which
flows from the lake where there is the great waterfall,” _i.e._ FOYERS;
and the other, “the waterfall of the moorish uplands,” which every one
understands who walks up to it.

So much for the features of unappropriated nature, stereotyped, as it
were, at once and for ever, in the old names of local scenery. But as
into a landscape an artist will inoculate his sentiment and symbolise
his fancy, so on the face of the earth men are fond to stamp the
trace of their habitation and their history. Under this influence the
nomenclature of topography becomes at once changed from a picture of
natural scenery to a record of human fortunes. And in this department
it is plain that the less varied and striking the features of nature,
the greater the necessity of marking places by the artificial
differentiation produced by the presence of human dwellings. Hence, in
the flat, monotonous plains of North Germany, the abundance of places
ending in _hausen_ and _heim_, which are only the Saxon forms of our
English _house_ and _home_. Of the termination _hausen_, SACHSENHAUSEN,
the home of the Saxons, and FRANKENHAUSEN, the home of the Franks, are
amongst the most notable examples. _Heim_ is pleasantly associated with
refreshing draughts in HOCHHEIM, _i.e._ high home, on the north bank
of the Rhine a little below Mainz, whence a sharp, clear wine being
imported, with the loss of the second syllable, and the transformation
of _ch_ into _k_, produced the familiar hock. This _heim_ in a thousand
places of England becomes _ham_, but in Scotland, where the Celtic
element prevails, appears only rarely in the south-east and near the
English border, as in COLDINGHAM and EDNAM--the birthplace of the poet
Thomson--contracted from Edenham. Another root very widely expressive
of human habitation, under the varying forms of _beth_, _bo_, and _by_,
is scattered freely from the banks of Jordan to the islands of the
Hebrides in the north-west of Scotland. First under this head we have
the great army of Hebrew _beths_, not a few of which are familiar to
our ear from the cherished teachings of early childhood, as--BETHABARA,
the house of the ferry; BETHANY, the house of dates; BETHAVEN, the
house of naughtiness; BETHCAR, the house of lambs; BETHDAGON, the house
of the fish-god Dagon; BETHEL, the house of God; BETHSHEMESH, the house
of the sun (like the Greek Heliopolis); and a score of others. _Bo_ is
the strictly Danish form of the root, at least in the dictionary, where
the verb _boe_, to dwell, also appears. Examples of this are found
in SKIBO, in Ross-shire, and BUNESS, at the extreme end of Unst, the
seat of the Edmonstones, a family well known in the annals of Shetland
literature; but more generally, in practice, it takes the softened form
of _by_, as in hundreds of local designations in England, specially
in Lincolnshire, where the Danes were for a long time at home. Near
the English border, as in LOCKERBY, this same termination appears;
otherwise in Scotland it is rare. In the Sclavonic towns of Mecklenburg
and Prussia, it takes the form of _bus_, as in PYBUS, while in Cornish
it is _bos_, which is a later form of _bod_ (German _bude_, English
_booth_, Scotch _bothy_), which stands out prominently in Bodmin and
other towns, not only in Cornwall, but in Wales. The termination _bus_
appears likewise in not a few local designations in the island of
Islay, where the Danes had many settlements. In Skye it appears as
_bost_, as in SKEABOST, one of the oldest seats of the Macdonalds.
The other Saxon or Scandinavian terms frequently met with throughout
England and in the north-east of Scotland are--_ton_, _setter_ or
_ster_, _stead_, _stow_, _stoke_, _hay_, _park_, _worth_, _bury_,
_thorp_, _toft_, _thwaite_. In Germany, besides _heim_ and _hausen_, as
already mentioned, we have the English _hay_, under the form _hagen_,
a fence; and _thorp_ under the form _dorf_, a village; and _worth_
under the forms _worth_ and _werth_, which are merely variations of
the Greek χόρτος, English yard, and the Sclavonic _gard_ and _gorod_,
and the Celtic _garad_, the familiar word in the Highlands for a stone
wall or dyke. In Germany, also, _weiler_, from _weilen_, to dwell, and
_leben_, to live, are thickly sprinkled; _hof_, also, is extremely
common, signifying a court or yard--a suffix which the French, in that
part of Germany which they stole from the Empire, turned into _court_
or _ville_, as in _Thionville_ from _Diedenhofen_.

So much for the Teutonic part of this branch of topographical
designation. In the Highlands _tigh_ and _bail_ are the commonest
words to denote a human dwelling, the one manifestly an aspirated form
of the Latin _tignum_ (Greek στἐγος, German _dach_), and the other
as plainly identical with the πόλις which appears in Sebastopol, and
not a few cities, both ancient and modern, where Greek influence or
Greek affectation prevailed. With regard to _bal_, it is noticeable
that in Ireland it generally takes the form of _bally_, which is the
full form of the word in Gaelic also, _baile_, there being no final
mute vowels in that language; but in composition for topographical use
final _e_ is dropped, as in BALMORAL, the majestic town or house, from
_morail_, magnificent, a very apt designation for a royal residence,
by whatever prophetic charm it came to be so named before her present
Majesty learned the healthy habit of breathing pure Highland air amid
the fragrant birches and clear waters of Deeside. _Tigh_, though less
common than _bal_, is not at all unfrequent in the mountains; and
tourists in the West Highlands are sure to encounter two of the most
notable between Loch Lomond and Oban. The first, TYNDRUM, the house
on the ridge, at the point where the ascent ceases as you cross from
Killin to Dalmally; and the other TAYNUILT, or the house of the brook,
in Scotch burnhouse, beyond Ben Cruachan, where the road begins to wend
through the rich old copsewood towards Oban. I remember also a curious
instance of the word _tigh_ in a local designation, half-way between
Inveraray and Loch Awe. In that district a little farmhouse on the
right of the road is called TIGHNAFEAD, _i.e._ whistle-house (_fead_,
a whistle, Latin _fides_), which set my philological fancy immediately
on the imagination that this exposed place was so called from some
peculiar whistling of the blast down from the hills immediately behind;
but such imaginations are very unsafe; for the fact turned out to be,
if somewhat less poetical, certainly much more comfortable, that this
house of call, in times within memory, stood at a greater distance
from the road than it now does, which caused the traveller, when he
came down the descent on a cold night, sharp-set for a glass of strong
whisky, to make his presence and his wish known by a shrill whistle
across the hollow.

So much for _tigh_. The only other remark that I would make here
is, that the word _clachan_, so well known from Scott’s Clachan of
Aberfoyle, does not properly mean a village, as Lowlanders are apt
to imagine, but only a churchyard, or, by metonymy, a church--as the
common phrase used by the natives, _Di domhnaich dol do’n chlachan_,
“going to church on Sunday,” sufficiently proves--the word properly
meaning only the stones in the churchyard, which mark the resting-place
of the dead; and if the word is ever used for a village, it is only by
transference to signify the village in which the parish church is, and
the parish churchyard.

But it is not only the dwellings of men, but their actions, that make
places interesting; and as the march of events in great historical
movements generally follows the march of armies, it follows that camps
and battle-fields and military settlements will naturally have left
strong traces in the topography of every country where human beings
dwell. And accordingly we find that the _chester_ and the _caster_,
added as a generic term to so many English towns, are simply the sites
of ancient Roman _castra_ or camps; while Cologne, on the Rhine, marks
one of the most prosperous of their settlements in Germany. Curiously
analogous to this is the _Cöln_, a well-known quarter of Berlin, on the
Spree, where the German emperors first planted a Teutonic colony in
the midst of a Sclavonic population. In the solemn march of Ossianic
poetry, the word _blar_ generally signifies a field of battle; but, as
this word properly signifies only a large field or open space, we have
no right to say that such names as BLAIR ATHOL and BLAIRGOWRIE have
anything to do with the memory of sanguinary collisions. ALEXANDRIA,
in Egypt, is one of the few remaining places of note that took their
name from the brilliant Macedonian Helleniser of the East. ALEXANDRIA,
in the vale of Leven, in Dumbartonshire, tells of the family of
Smollett, well known in the annals of Scottish literary genius, and
still, by their residence, adding a grace to one of the most beautiful
districts of lake scenery in the world. ADRIANOPLE stereotypes the
memory of one of the most notable of the Roman emperors, who deemed it
his privilege and pleasure to visit the extremest limits of his vast
dominions, and leave some beneficial traces of his kingship there. The
name PETERSBURG, whose Teutonic character it is impossible to ignore,
indicates the civilisation of a Sclavonic country by an emperor whose
early training was received from a people of German blood and breed;
while CONSTANTINOPLE recalls the momentous change which took place in
the centre of gravity of the European world, when the declining empire
of the Roman Cæsars was about to become Greek in its principal site,
as it had long been in its dominant culture. The streets of great
cities, as one may see prominently in Paris, in their designations
often contain a register of the most striking events of their national
history. Genuine names of streets in old cities are a historical growth
and an anecdotal record, which only require the pen of a cunning writer
to make them as attractive as a good novel. London, in this view, is
particularly interesting; and Emerson, I recollect, in his book, _How
the Great City grew_ (London, 1862), tells an amusing story about the
great fire in London, which certain pious persons observed to have
commenced at a street called PUDDING LANE, and ended at a place called
PYE CORNER, in memory of which they caused the figure of a fat boy to
be put up at Smithfield, with the inscription on his stomach, “This
boy is in memory put up for the late fire of London, occasioned by the
sin of gluttony, 1666.” Many a dark and odorous close in Old Edinburgh
also, to men who, like the late Robert Chambers, could read stones
with knowing eyes, is eloquent with those tales of Celtic adventure
and Saxon determination which make the history of Scotland so full
of dramatic interest; while, on the other hand, the flunkeyism of
the persons who, to tickle the lowest type of aristocratic snobbery,
baptized certain streets of New Edinburgh with BUCKINGHAM Terrace,
BELGRAVE Crescent, GROSVENOR Street, and such like apish mimicry of
metropolitan West Endism, stinks in the nostrils and requires no
comment. But not only to grimy streets of reeking towns, but to the
broad track of the march of the great lines of the earth’s surface,
there is attached a nomenclature which tells the history of the
adventurous captain, or the courageous commander, who first redeemed
these regions from the dim limbo of the unknown, and brought them into
the distinct arena of cognisable and manageable facts. In the frosty
bounds of the far North-West, the names of MACKENZIE, MACLINTOCK, and
MACLURE proclaim the heroic daring that belongs so characteristically
to the Celtic blood in Scotland. But it is in the moral triumphs of
religion, which works by faith in what is noble, love of what is good,
and reverence for what is great, that the influence of history over
topographical nomenclature is most largely traced. In ancient Greece,
the genial piety which worshipped its fairest Avatar in the favourite
sun-god Apollo, stamped its devotion on the name of APOLLONIA, on
the Ionian Sea, and other towns whose name was legion. In CORNWALL,
almost every parish is named after some saintly apostle, who, in days
of savage wildness and wastefulness, had brought light and peace and
humanity into these remote regions. In the Highlands of Scotland, the
KILBRIDES (_kill_ from _cella_, a shrine), KILMARTINS, KILMARNOCKS, and
KILMALLIES everywhere attest the grateful piety of the forefathers of
the Celtic race in days which, if more dark, were certainly not more
cold than the times in which we now live. In the Orkneys the civilising
influence of the clergy, or, in some cases, no doubt, their love for
pious seclusion, is frequently marked by the PAPAS or priests’ islands.
In Germany, MUNICH or MONACUM, which shows a monk in its coat-of-arms,
has retained to the present day the zeal for sacerdotal sanctitude
from which it took its name; and the same must be said of MUENSTER,
in Westphalia (from μοναστῆρι, in modern Greek a cathedral, English
minster), the metropolis of Ultramontane polity and priestly pretension
in Northern Germany.

But it is not only in commemorating, like coins, special historical
events, that local names act as an important adjunct to written
records; they give likewise the clue to great ethnological facts and
movements of which written history preserves no trace. In this respect
topographical etymology presents a striking analogy to geology; for,
as the science of the constitution of the earth’s crust reveals a
fossilised history of life in significant succession, long antecedent
to the earliest action of the human mind on the objects of terrestrial
nature, so the science of language to the practised eye discloses a
succession of races in regions where no other sign of their existence
remains. If it were doubted, for instance, whether at any period the
Lowlands of Scotland had been possessed by a Celtic race, and asserted
roundly that from the earliest times the plains had been inhabited
by a people of Teutonic blood, and only the mountain district to the
west and north-west was the stronghold of the Celt, the obvious names
of not a few localities in the east and south-east of Scotland would
present an impassable bar to the acceptance of any such dogma. One
striking instance of this occurs in Haddingtonshire, where a parish
is now called GARAVALT--by the very same appellation as a well-known
waterfall near Braemar, in the hunting forest of the late Prince
Consort; and with the same propriety in both cases, for the word
in Gaelic signifies a _rough brook_, and such a brook is the most
striking characteristic of both districts. Cases of this kind clearly
indicate the vanishing of an original Celtic people from districts
now essentially Teutonic both in speech and character. The presence
of a great Sclavonic people in Northern Germany, and of an extensive
Sclavonic immigration into Greece in mediæval times, is attested with
the amplest certitude in the same way. A regular fringe of Scandinavian
names along the north and north-west coast of Scotland would, to the
present hour, attest most indubitably the fact of a Norse dominion in
those quarters operating for centuries, even had Haco and the battle
of Largs been swept altogether from the record of history and from the
living tradition of the people. To every man who has been in Norway,
LAXFIORD, in West Ross-shire, a stream well known to salmon-fishers,
carries this Scandinavian story on its face; and no man who has walked
the streets of Copenhagen will have any difficulty, when he sails
into the beautiful bay of Portree, in knowing the meaning of the
great cliff called the STORR, which he sees along the coast a little
towards the north; for this means simply the great cliff, _storr_ being
the familiar Danish for great, as _mor_ is the Gaelic. Ethnological
maps may in this way be constructed exactly in the same fashion as
geological; and the sketch of one such for Great Britain the reader
will find in Mr. Taylor’s well-known work on _Names and Places_.

With regard to the law of succession in these ethnological strata,
as indicated by topographical nomenclature, the following three
propositions may be safely laid down:--1. The names of great objects
of natural scenery, particularly of mountains and rivers, will
generally be significant in the language of the people who were
the original inhabitants of the country. 2. Names of places in the
most open and accessible districts of a country will be older than
similar names in parts which are more difficult of access; but--3,
these very places being most exposed to foreign invasion, are apt
to invite an adventurous enemy, whose settlement in the conquered
country is generally accompanied with a partial, sometimes with a very
considerable, change of local nomenclature.

In reference to this change of population, Mr. Taylor in one place uses
the significant phrase, “The hills contain the ethnological sweepings
of the plains.” Very true; but the effect of this on the ethnological
character of the population of the places is various, and in the
application requires much caution. It is right, for instance, to say
generally that the Celtic language has everywhere in Europe retreated
from the plains into the mountainous districts; but the people often
still remain where the language has retreated, as the examination of
any directory in many a district of Scotland, where only English is now
spoken, will largely show. In Greece, in the same way, many districts
present only Greek and Sclavonic names of places, where the population,
within recent memory, is certainly Albanian. Inquiries of this nature
always require no less caution than learning; otherwise, as Mr. Skene
observes, what might have been, properly conducted, an all-important
element in fixing the ethnology of any country, becomes, in rash hands
and with hot heads, a delusion and a snare.[1]

But the science of language, when wisely conducted, not only presents
an interesting analogy to geological stratification; it sometimes goes
further, and bears direct witness to important geological changes as
conclusive as any evidence derived from the existing conformation of
the earth’s crust. How this comes to pass may easily be shown by a
few familiar examples. The words _wold_ and _weald_ originally meant
_wood_ and _forest_, as the Anglo-Saxon Dictionary and the living use
of the German language--_wald_--alike declare; but the wolds at present
known in Yorkshire, Gloucestershire, and other parts of England,
are generally bare and treeless, and in bad weather very cheerless
places indeed. If, then, “there is nothing arbitrary in language,”
and all local names tell an historical tale, it is certain that, at
the time when those names were imposed, these same sites were part of
an immense forest. The geologist, when, in the far-stretching bogs
east of Glencoe, and near Kinloch Ewe, and in many other places of
Scotland, he calls attention to the fact of layers of gigantic trees
lying now deeply embedded under the peat, adduces an argument with
regard to the primitive vegetation of our part of the world not a
whit more convincing. The same fact of a lost vegetation is revealed
in not a few places of England which end in the old word _hurst_,
signifying a forest. Again, there is a large family of places in and
about the Harz Mountains, in Germany, ending in _ode_, as OSTERODE,
HASSELRODE, WERNINGERODE, and so forth. Now most of these places, as
specially HASSELRODE, are now remarkably free from those leagues of
leafy luxuriance that give such a marked character to the scenery of
that mountain district. It is certain, however, that they were at one
time in the centre of an immense forest; for the word _rode_, radically
the same as our _rid_, and perhaps the Welsh _rhydd_, Gaelic _reidh_,
simply means “to make clear” or “clean,” and teaches that the forest in
that part had been cleared for human habitation.

Once more: it is a well-known fact in geology that the border limit
between sea and land is constantly changing, the briny element in some
cliffy places, as to the north of Hull, systematically undermining the
land, and stealing away the farmer’s acreage inch by inch and foot by
foot; while in other places, from the conjoint action of river deposits
and tidal currents, large tracts of what was once a sea-bottom are
added to the land. The geological proof of this is open often to the
most superficial observer; but the philological proof, when you once
hold the key of it, is no less patent. In the Danish language--which
is a sort of half-way house between high German and English--the word
_oe_ signifies an island. This _oe_, in the shape of _ay_, _ea_, _ey_,
or _y_, appears everywhere on the British coast, particularly in the
West Highlands, as in COLONSAY, TOROSAY, ORANSAY, and in ORKNEY; and if
there be any locality near the sea wearing this termination, not now
surrounded by water, the conclusion is quite certain, on philological
grounds, that it once was so. Here the London man will at once think on
BERMONDSEY and CHELSEA, and he will think rightly; but he must not be
hasty to draw STEPNEY under the conditions of the same category, for
the EY in that word, if I am rightly informed, is a corruption from
_hithe_, a well-known Anglo-Saxon and good old English term signifying
a _haven_; and generally, in all questions of topographical etymology,
there is a risk of error where the old spelling of the word is not
confronted with the form which, by the attritions and abrasions of
time, it may have assumed.

These observations, which at the request of the author of the following
pages I have hastily set down, will be sufficient to indicate the
spirit in which the study of topographical etymology ought to be
pursued. Of course, I have no share in the praise which belongs to the
successful execution of so laborious an investigation; neither, on
the other hand, can blame be attached to me for such occasional slips
as the most careful writer may make in a matter where to err is easy,
and where conjecture has so long been in the habit of usurping the
place of science. But I can bear the most honest witness to the large
research, sound judgment, and conscientious accuracy of the author;
and feel happy to have my name, in a subsidiary way, connected with a
work which, I am convinced, will prove an important addition to the
furniture of our popular schools.

a stream; from Old Norse _â_, Goth. _aha_, Old Ger. _aha_ (water). The
word, in various forms, occurs frequently in river names throughout
Western Europe, especially in Germany and the Netherlands, and often
takes the form of _au_ or _ach_; _e.g._ the rivers Aa, Ach, Aach;
Saltach (salt river); Wertach (a river with many islands)--_v._ WARID,

(green stream); Dachau (the clayey stream); Fulda, _i.e._ _Fold-aha_
(land stream); Rod-aha (reedy stream); Saale and Saala from _salz_
(salt stream). The simple _a_ or _o_, with a prefix expressive of
the character of the stream, is the most frequent form of the word
in Iceland and Scandinavia, and in the districts of Great Britain
colonised by Norsemen or Danes; _e.g._ Laxa (salmon river); Hvita
(white river); Brora (bridge river); Rotha (red river); Greta (weeping
river); Storaa (great river); Thurso (Thor’s river), which gives its
name to the town; Lossie, anc. _Laxi-a_ (salmon river).

water; _e.g._ Doab (the district of two waters); Menab (the mouth of
the water), on the Persian Gulf; Busheab or _Khoshaub_ (good water), a
river in Hindostan, also an island in the Persian Gulf; Neelab (blue
water); Punjaub (the district of the five streams); Chinab or Chenaub
R., said to be a corrupt. of its former name _Chaudra Bhagee_ (the
garden of the moon), so called from a small lake of that name from
which it proceeds. Cognate with this root is the Gadhelic _abh_, in its
forms of _aw_ or _ow_. Thus in Scotland we have the River Awe and Loch
Awe; in Ireland, Ow and Owbeg (little stream); Ow-nageerah (the stream
of the sheep); Finnow (clear stream). Cognate with these root-words is
the Lat. _aqua_ and its derivations in the Romance languages, as well
as _ae_ or _ea_ (A.S. water). Forsteman finds river names, allied to
the foregoing, throughout Germany and France, in such forms as _ap_,

[Sidenote: ABER (Cym.-Cel.),
ABHIR and OBAIR (Gael.),]

a confluence of waters; applied, in topography, to places at the conf.
of streams, or at the embouchure of a river. The derivation of the
term has been traced by some etymologists to the conjunction of _ath_
(Gael.), a ford, and _bior_, water; by others to Cym.-Cel. _at_ (at)
and _bior_ (water). This prefix is general in many of the counties
of Scotland, throughout Wales, and, in a few instances, in Ireland,
although in the latter country the synonyms _inver_ and _cumar_ are
more frequent. Both words are found in the topography of the Picts,
but the Scots of Argyleshire used only _inver_ before they came from
Ireland to settle in that district. The word _aber_ seems to have
become obsolete among them; and as there are no _abers_ in Ayrshire,
Renfrew, and Lanarkshire, the word had probably become obsolete before
the kingdom of Strathclyde was formed. Dr. Joyce, in his _Irish Names
of Places_, traces its use as prefix or affix to the Irish root _abar_
(a mire), as in the little stream Abberachrinn (_i.e._ the river of
the miry place of the tree). In Wales we find Aberconway, Aberfraw,
Aberistwyth, Aberavon, Aberayron, Aberdare, Aberdaron, Abergavenny, at
the embouchure of the _Conway_, _Fraw_, _Istwyth_, _Avon_, _Aeron_,
_Dar_, _Daron_, _Gavenny_. Barmouth, corrupt. from Aber-Mowddy, a
seaport in Merioneth, at the mouth of the R. Mowddy. Berriew, corrupt.
from Aber-Rhiw (at the junction of the R. Rhiw with the Severn);
Aberdaugledden, the Welsh name for Haverford-west, at the mouth of twin
rivers resembling two swords (_gledden_), which unite at Milford Haven.
It is called by the Welsh now Hwlford (the sailing road) because the
tide comes up to the town. Aberhonddu, at the mouth of the R. Honddi or
Honddu (the county town of Brecknock), and Aberdovey, at the embouchure
of the R. Dovey in Wales. In Scotland, Aberbrothwick or Arbroath,
Abercorn, anc. _Aeber-curnig_, Aberdour, Abergeldie, Abernethy, at the

territory of a Celtic monastery.

[Sidenote: ACH, or ICH,]

a form of the Teut. _aha_ (water), p. 1, as in Salzach (salt stream),
but it is also a common affix to words in the Teut. and Cel. languages,
by which a noun is formed into an adjective, signifying full of, or
abounding in, equivalent to the Lat. terminations _etum_ and _iacum_.
Thus, in German topography, we find Lindach, Aichach, Aschach,

of Britain, _Albion_, has sometimes been traced to this root, but more
generally to the _white_ cliffs (Lat. _albus_) on the coast of Kent, as

[Sidenote: ARA,]

a frequent element in river names, with various and even opposite
meanings. Some of the river names may have come from the Sansc. _ara_
(swift, or the flowing), and in Tamil _aar_ means simply a river. There
is another Sanscrit word _arb_ (to ravage or destroy), with which
the Gadhelic words _garw_, _garbh_ (rough) may be connected; and, on
the other hand, there is the Welsh _araf_ (gentle). According to the
locality and the characteristics of the stream, one must judge to
which of these roots its name may belong. There are, in England, the
Aire, Arre, Arro, Arrow; in France, the Arve, Erve, Arveiron, etc.; in
Switzerland and Germany, the Aar, Are; in Spain and Italy, the Arva,
Arno; and in Scotland, the Ayr, Aray, Irvine, etc. Many of these names
may signify simply flowing water (the river), while others beginning
with the syllable _ar_ may be referred to the adjectival forms, _araf_,
_arb_, _ara_, or _garbh_, followed by another root-word for _water_, as
in Arrow (the swift stream); Yarrow (the rough stream); _ow_ (water);
Arveiron (the furious stream); _avon_ (water); Arar (the gentle
stream), now the Saone.

Lat. root _arduus_ (high) is found in Ardea, in Italy; the Ardes (or
heights), in Auvergne; Auvergne itself has been traced to _Ar-fearann_
(high lands), but Cocheris, _Au Noms de Lieu_, gives its ancient name
as _Alverniacus_ (_i.e._ the domain of the _Auvergni_). Ardennes,
Forest of (high-wooded valleys); Ardwick-le-street (the high town on
the great Roman road), _stratum_. _Ard_, _art_, and _artha_ are also
Persian prefixes attached to the names of places and persons; _e.g._
Ardboodha (the high place of Buddha); Aravalli (the hill of strength);
and such personal names as Artaxerxes, Artabanes, Artamenes. In some
cases it may refer to the agricultural habits of the Indo-Germanic
races (Lat. _aro_, Grk. αροω, Goth. _arjan_, Old High Ger. _aran_, Cel.
_ar_ (to plough), hence the Aryan tribes are those belonging to the

often used to denote a ford; _e.g._ Belclair, _i.e._ _Bel-an-chlair_
(the ford or entrance to the plain); _Belatha_ (Anglicised _Bella_)
is found in many names, as in Bellanagare, _i.e._ _Bel-atha-na-gcarr_

armies); _Bel_ (a ford) is not found in Scotland, but a word with a
kindred meaning as applied to land, _bealach_ (a pass or opening
between hills), is frequent there, as well as in Ireland, and takes
the form of _ballagh_ or _balloch_; _e.g._ Ballaghboy in Ireland, and
Ballochbuie in Scotland (the yellow pass); Ballaghmore (great pass);
Ballaghkeen (the beautiful pass, _cæin_); Ballaghadereen (the pass of

BRIVA,]

a general name among the Celts for a town--so called, apparently,
from the Celtic words _braigh_, _brugh_, _brig_ (a heap, pile, or
elevation), because the nucleus of towns, among uncivilised tribes in
early times, were merely fortified places erected on heights; cognate
with the Teut. and Scand. _burg_, _byrig_, the Sclav. _brieg_ (an
embankment or ridge), and the Scottish _brae_ (a rising ground). Hence
the name of the _Brigantes_ (dwellers on hills); the word _Brigand_
(literally, a mountaineer); Briançon, anc. _Brigantium_ (the town on
the height); Brieg, a town in Silesia; Braga and Bragança, fortified

(the gray mountain, _riabhach_); the Brerachin, a river and district
in Perthshire; Brugh and Bruighean, in Ireland, signifying originally
a hill, was subsequently applied to a palace or a distinguished
residence. The term, as applied to the old residences, presupposed the
existence of a fortified brugh or rath, several of which still remain.
The word has suffered many corruptions: thus Bruree, in Limerick, is
from _Brugh-righ_ (the king’s fort); and _Bruighean_ (little fort)
has been transformed into Bruff, Bruis, Bruce, or Bryan. The word
_briva_, on the other hand, was generally applied to towns situated
on rivers--as in Amiens, anc. _Samarabrina_, on the R. Somme--and was
gradually used as synonymous with _pons_ (bridge), as in Pontoise, anc.

was originally applied to a circle of stones where the Pagan rites
of worship were wont to be celebrated; and, after the introduction
of Christianity, houses and churches were erected near these spots,

the expression used in asking a person if he is going to church
is--“_Am bheil-thu’dol do’n clachan?_” (_i.e._ “Are you going to the

Co. Monaghan, was _Cluain-Eois_ (the meadow of Eos, probably a Pagan

a place enclosed, the place occupied by a sovereign, a lordly mansion;
from the Lat. _cohors_, also _cors-cortis_ (an enclosed yard), cognate
with the Grk. _hortos_. The Romans called the castles built by Roman
settlers in the provinces _cortes_ or _cortem_, thence _court_ became
a common affix to the names of mansions in England and France--thus
Hampton Court and Hunton Court, in England; Leoncourt, Aubigne-court,
Honnecourt (the mansion of Leo, Albinius, and Honulf); Aubercourt (of
Albert); Mirecourt, Lat. _Mercurii-curtis_, where altars were wont

Cortiles, Cortina, Corticella, Courcelles, etc. The words _court_,
_cour_, and _corte_ were also used as equivalent to the Lat. _curia_
(the place of assembly for the provincial councils)--thus Corte, in
Corsica, where the courts of justice were held; but Corsica itself
derived its name from the Phœnician _chorsi_ (a woody place). The
Cortes, in Spain, evidently equivalent to the Lat. _curia_, gives
its name to several towns in that country; Coire, the capital of
the Grisons, in Switzerland, comes from the anc. _Curia Rhætiorum_
(the place where the provincial councils of the Rhætians were held);
Corbridge, in Northumberland, is supposed to take its name from a Roman
_curia_, and perhaps Currie, in East Lothian.

from its situation at a spot where roads cross each other. It was
usual with the Celts in Ireland, as well as with the Spaniards and
Portuguese in America, to mark the place where any providential event
had occurred, or where they founded a church or city, by erecting a

the cross of a person called Torphin. In the reign of James I. the
church of Corstorphine became a collegiate foundation, with a provost,
four prebendaries, and two singing boys. _Croich_ in Gaelic means a

DOL (Cym.-Cel.),
DAHL (Scand.),
THAL (Ger.),
DOL (Sclav.),]

a valley, sometimes a field, English _dale_ or _dell_, and often joined
to the name of the river which flows through the district; _e.g._

Nith, Liddel, Dove, Arun, Dryfe); Rochdale, on the Roch, an affluent
of the Trivell; Dalmellington (the town in the valley of the mill).
It is to be noted that in places named by the Teut. and Scand. races,
this root-word, as well as others, is placed after the adjective or
defining word; while by the Celtic races it is placed first. Thus, in
Scandinavia, and in localities of Great Britain where the Danes and
Norsemen had settlements, we have--Romsdalen and Vaerdal, the valleys
of the Raumer and Vaer, in Norway; Langenthal, on the R. Langent, in
Switzerland; Rydal (rye valley), Westmoreland; Laugdalr (the valley
of warm springs), Iceland. In districts again peopled by the Saxons,
Avondale, Annandale (the valleys of the Avon and Annan). This is the
general rule, although there are exceptions--Rosenthal (the valley of
roses); Inn-thal (of the R. Inn); Freudenthal (of joy); Fromenthal
(wheat valley); Grunthal (green valley). In Gaelic, Irish, and Welsh
names, on the contrary, _dal_ precedes the defining word; _e.g._ Dalry
and Dalrigh (king’s level field); Dalbeth and Dalbeathie (the field of
birches); Dalginross (the field at the head of the promontory or wood);
Dalness and Dallas (the field of the cascade, _cas_); Dalserf (of St.
Serf); Dailly, in Ayrshire, anc. _Dalmaolkeran_ (the field of the
servant, _maol_, of St. Kiaran); Dalrymple (the valley of the rumbling
pool, _ruaemleagh_); Dalgarnock (of the rough hillock); Dalhousie (the
field at the corner of the water, _i.e._ of the Esk); Dalwhinnie (the
field of the meeting, _coinneach_); Dalziel (beautiful field, _geal_);
Dalguise (of the fir-trees, _giuthas_); Dalnaspittal (the field of
the _spideal_, _i.e._ the house of entertainment); Dalnacheaich (of
the stone); Dalnacraoibhe (of the tree); Dalbowie (yellow field).
Dollar, in Clackmannan, may be from this root, although there is a
tradition that it took its name from a castle in the parish called
Castle-Gloom, Gael. _doillair_ (dark); Deal or Dole (the valley in
Kent); Dol and Dole, in Brittany, with the same meaning; Doldrewin (the
valley of the Druidical circles in Wales); Dolquan (the owl’s meadow);
Dolau-Cothi (the meadows of the River Cothi); Dolgelly (the grove of
hazels); Dalkeith (the narrow valley, _caeth_); Codale (cow field);

Northampton, corrupt. from _Avondle_; Kendal or Kirkby-Kendal (the

the grove), in Wales; Dolsk or Dolzig (the town in the valley), in
Posen; Dolzen, in Bohemia; Bartondale (the dale of the enclosure for
the gathered crops), in Yorkshire; Dalarossie, in Inverness, corrupt.
from _Dalfergussie_, Fergus’dale; Dalriada, in Ulster, named from a
king of the Milesian race, named _Cairbe-Raida_, who settled there.
His descendants gradually emigrated to Albin, which from them was
afterwards called Scotland; and that part of Argyleshire where they
landed they also named Dalriada. The three brothers, Fergus, Sorn, and
Anghus, came to Argyleshire in 503 A.D. Toul and Toulouse, situated
in valleys, probably were named from the same root-word; Toulouse was
anciently called _Civitas-Tolosatium_ (the city of the valley dwellers,
_dol-saetas_).

Denshanger (Danes’ hill or declivity); Dantzic (the Danish fort,
built by a Danish colony in the reign of Waldemar II.); Tennstedt, in
Saxony, corrupt. from _Dannenstedi_ (the Danes’ station); Cruden, in
Aberdeenshire, anc. _Cruor-Danorum_ (the slaughter of the Danes on the
site of the last battle between the Celts and the Danes, which took
place in the parish 1012). The Danish king fell in this battle, and was
buried in the churchyard of Cruden. For centuries the Erroll family
received an annual pension from the Danish Government for taking care

with the form of religion practised by their inhabitants--as in
Deutsch-hanmer (the Protestant village, opposed to Katholic-hanmer,
belonging to the Catholic or Greek Church). In other cases it is
opposed to _Walsch_ (foreign--_v._ WALSCH), as in Deutsch-steinach and
Walsh-steinach (the German and foreign towns on the _Steinach_, or
stony water). The Romans employed the word _Germania_ for _Deutsch_,
which Professor Leo traces to a Celtic root _gair-mean_ (one who
cries out or shouts); _e.g._ Deutschen, in the Tyrol; Deutz, in
Rhenish Prussia; Deutschendorf, in Hungary; Deutschenhausen, in
Moravia, i.e. the dwellings of the Germans. The earliest name by
which the Germans designated themselves seems to have been _Tungri_

_Dutch_ was restricted to the Low Germans. The French name for Germany
is modernised from the _Alemanni_ (a mixed race, and probably means

[Sidenote: ING, INGEN, INGA,]

an affix used by the Teutonic races, as a patronymic, in the same
sense as _Mac_ is used in Scotland, _ap_ in Wales, and _O_ in Ireland.
_Ing_ is generally affixed to the settlement of a chief, and _ingen_
to that of his descendants. _Ing_, preceding _ham_, _ton_, _dean_,
_ley_, _thorp_, _worth_, etc., is generally an abbreviation of _ingen_,
and denotes that the place belonged to the family of the tribe, as
in Bonnington, Collington, Collingham, Islington (the home of the
Bonnings, the Collings, and the Islings). In French topography _ingen_
takes the forms of _igny_, _igné_, or _inges_; and it appears, by
comparing the names of many towns and villages in England and the
north-west of France with those of Germany, that Teutonic tribes
forming settlements in these countries transferred the names in their
native land to their new homes. For the full elucidation of this
subject reference may be made to Taylor’s _Words and Places_, chap.
vii. and the Appendix, and to Edmund’s _Names of Places_, p. 58.
Only a few examples of the use of this patronymic can be given here;
thus, from the _Offings_--Oving and Ovingham, corresponding to the
Ger. Offingen and the Fr. Offignes. From the _Eppings_--Epping, Ger.
Eppinghofen, and Fr. Epagne. The _Bings_--Bing, Bingham, Bingley;
Ger. Bingen; Fr. Buigny. The _Basings_--Eng. Basing, Basingham,
Bessingby; Fr. Bazigny. From the _Raedings_--Reading, Co. Berks.
The _Harlings_--Harlington. The _Billings_--Bellington. From the
_Moerings_ or _Merovingians_ many French towns and villages are named;
_e.g._ Morigny, Marigné, Merignac, Merrigny; in England--Merring,
Merrington. We can sometimes trace these tribe names to the nature of
the localities which they inhabited. Thus the _Bucings_, from which we
have Boking and Buckingham, to a locality abounding in beech-trees,
_boc_; the _Durotriges_, from which we have Dorset and Dorchester, are
the dwellers by the water, _dur_; as well as the _Eburovices_, who gave
their name to Evreux, in France. _Ing_, also, in A.S. names, sometimes
means a meadow, as in Clavering, in Essex (clover meadow), A.S.
_Claefer_; Mountnessing, Co. Essex (the meadow of the Mountneys, who
were formerly lords of the manor); Godalming (the meadow of Godhelm).

in connection with _aber_, the word _inver_ being found sometimes at

[Sidenote: LANN (Gadhelic),
LLAN (Cym.-Cel.),
LAND (Teut.),]

an enclosure, a church, a house; but Mr. Skene considers that the
Cel. _llan_ comes from the Lat. _planum_ (a level place), just as
the Gael. _lan_ (full) comes from the Lat. _plenus_. This word is
more common in Welsh names than in the topography of Ireland and
Scotland, and in its signification of a church forms the groundwork of
a vast number of Welsh names. In Ireland it means a house as well as
a church, as in Landbrock (the badger’s house); Landmore (the great
church), in Londonderry; Landahussy (O’Hussy’s church), in Tyrone;
Lanaglug (the church of the bells). It is not so frequent in Scotland,
but the modern name of Lamlash, in the Island of Arran, formerly
_Ard-na-Molas_, the height of St. Molios, who lived in a cave there,
seems to be the church or enclosure of this saint; Lambride, in Forfar,
is _Lannbride_ (St. Bridget’s church); Lumphanan is from _Lann-Finan_
(St. Finan’s church). The derivation of Lanark, anc. _Lanerk_, is
probably from the Welsh _Llanerch_ (a distinct spot or fertile piece
of ground). There are many examples of this root in Brittany; _e.g._
Lanleff (the enclosure on the R. Leff); Lanmeur (great church);
Lannion (the little enclosure); Landerneau and Lannoy (the enclosure
on the water); but in French topography the Teut. _land_ generally
signifies uncultivated ground; _e.g._ La Lande, Landes, Landelles, La
Landelle, Les Landais, Landau, etc.--_v._ Cocheris’s _Noms de Lieu_.
Launceston, in Cornwall, is probably corrupt. from _Llan-Stephen_. The
greatest number of our examples must be taken from Wales. There are
Lantony or _Llan-Ddevinant_ (the church of St. David in the valley,
_nant_, of the R. Hodeny); Llan-Dewi-Aberarth (St. David’s church at
the mouth of the Arth); Lampeter (of St. Peter); Llan-Asaph (of St.
Asaph); Llanbadern-fawr (the great church founded by Paternus), also
Llan-Badarn-Odyn; Llandelo-vawr (of Feilo the Great); Llandewi-Brefi
(St. David’s church). Brevi here means the bellowing, from the dismal
moans of a sacred animal killed here; Llandovery, corrupt. from
_Llan-ym-dyffrwd_ (the church among the rivers, at the confluence of
three streams); Llanudno (of St. Tudno); Llanelly (of St. Elian);
Llanfair (of St. Mary); Llanover (the church of the Gover wells);

on the hill); Llanfair-helygen (St. Mary’s church among willows);

Llanfihangel-genau’r-glyn (the church of the angels at the opening of
the valley); Llanfihangel-y-creuddin, a church erected probably on the
site of a bloody battle; Llanfihangel-lledrod (the church at the foot
of a declivity); Llangadogvawr (of St. Cadoc the Great); Llangeler (of
St. Celert); Llangollen (of St. Collen); Llanidloes (of St. Idloes);
Llaniestyn (of St. Constantine); Llannethlin, anc. _Mediolanum_ (the
church among the pools or marshes); Llantrissant (of three saints);
Llanddeusaint (of two saints); Llanberis (of St. Peres); Llandegla (of
St. Theckla); Llanrhaiadr (the church of the cataract); Llanfaes (the
church of the battle-field); Landaff, on the R. Taff; Llangoedmore
(the church of the great wood); Llanaml-lech (the church on the stony

which was a sainted well famous for its medicinal properties, and which
was resorted to by crowds of impotent folk); Llancilcen (the church
in the nook, _cil_, at the top, _cen_, of a hill), a parish in Flint;
Llan-mabon (of St. Mabon); Llan-Beblig, corrupt. from _Bublicius_,
named for the son of Helen, a Welsh princess; Llan-sant-Fagan, named
in honour of St. Faganus, a missionary from Rome. _Llan_ is sometimes
corrupted to _long_ in Scotland, as in Longniddrie; Lagny, a town
in France, anc. _Laniacum_ (the church or enclosure on the stream).
From the Teut. _land_, _i.e._ a country or district, some names may
come in appropriately under this head--thus Scotland (the land of
the Scots), from Ireland; Monkland, in Lanarkshire (belonging to the
monks); Natland, in Norway (the land of horned cattle); Sutherland
(the southern land, as compared with Caithness), both Sutherland and
Caithness having formed part of the Orkney Jarldom; Cumberland (the

a corrupt. of _Leath-rath_ (half rath), as in Laragh, in West Meath;

[Sidenote: TEACH and TIGH (Gadhelic),

a house or dwelling, cognate with the Lat. _tectum_, Ger. _dach_, and
Scand. _tag_, a roof; Anglicised _tagh_, in the genitive, _tigh_.
This word, under various forms, is common in Irish topography; _e.g._

[Sidenote: TEINE (Gadhelic),
TÂN (Cym.-Cel.),]

fire. In topography this word is found in the forms of _tin_ and
_tinny_, and must indicate spots where fires of special importance were
wont to be kindled. Whether these fires were beacon-fires, or whether
they referred to the Beltane fires kindled by the ancient Celts on May
Day, cannot, in special cases, be determined; but that the Beltane
fires were connected with the religious rites of the Druids is allowed,
even by those who do not derive the word _Beltane_ from the name of a
Celtic deity, or trace the observance of these rites to the sun and
fire worship once alleged to have existed among the Celtic tribes, but
now held to be an untenable theory by Celtic scholars.[5] In Ireland,
near Coleraine, we find Kiltinny (the wood of the fire); Tamnaghvelton
(the field of the Beltane sports); Clontinty, Co. Cork (the meadow of
the fires); Mollynadinta, anc. _Mullaigh-na-dtaeinte_ (the summit of

[Sidenote: THING, or TING,]

a term applied by the Scandinavians to the legislative assemblies of
their nation, and also to the places where these assemblies met, from
an old word _tinga_, to speak. Traces of these institutions appear
in the topography of certain districts in Great Britain formerly
occupied by Danes or Norwegians. The Norwegian Parliament is still
called the _Storthing_ or great assembly; smaller courts are called
_Lawthings_, and the _Althing_ was the general assembly of the whole
nation. These meetings were generally held on some remote island,
hill, or promontory, where their deliberations might be undisturbed.
The Swedish Parliament used to assemble on a mound near Upsala, which
still bears the name of _Tingshogen_, Scand. _haugr_; Thingveller (the
council-plains), in Iceland; Sandsthing (the place of meeting on the
sand), in Iceland; Aithsthing (the meeting-place on the headland),

Dinsdale in Durham, from the same root; Tinwald, in Dumfries (the wood
of the meeting); Tain, in Ross-shire, Norse _Thing_--its Gaelic name is
_Baile-Duich_ (St. Duthic’s town).

prefixes derived from the Saxon and Scandinavian deity _Thor_; _e.g._
Thorley, Thurley, Thursley, Thorsby, Thurlow, the valley, dwelling,

derived from the god, _i.e._ the _Thurings_, from whence also probably
come Thorington in England, and Thorigné and Thorigny in France;
Thüringerwald, in Germany; Thurston, Thursford, Thurscross, Thurlstone,
etc.; Thorsoe (Thor’s island); Thurso (Thor’s stream, on which the
town of Thurso is situated); Thorshaven (Thor’s harbour), in Norway
and in the Faroe Islands. On the continent the god Thor was worshipped
under the name of Thunor, hence the English word _thunder_ and the
German _Donner_ (supposed, in the Middle Ages, to be Thor’s voice).
From this word are derived Thunersberg and Donnersberg (the mountain of
Thor); Donnersbach (Thor’s stream), in Styria; Torslunde (Thor’s sacred
grove), in Denmark.

[Sidenote: THORPE (A.S.),]

[Sidenote: TOBAR (Gadhelic),]

a fountain or well, from the old word _doboir_, water. Wells and
fountains were held in great veneration by the Celts in heathen times,
and are the subjects of many traditions in Ireland and Scotland. Many
of the early preachers of Christianity established their foundations
near these venerated wells, which were the common resorts of the
people whom they had come to convert. In this way the new religion
became associated in the minds of the converts with their favourite
wells, and obtained the names of the saints, by which they are known
to this day; _e.g._ Tobermory (St. Mary’s well), in the Island of
Mull; Tobar-na-bhan-thighern (the chieftainess’s well), in Badenoch;
Ballintobar (the town of the well), Co. Mayo, now called Tobermore (the
great well), which had a well blessed by St. Patrick; Tibbermore or

cauldron); Toberbilly (the well of the old tree); Tobernaclug (the well
of the bells, _clog_). Bells were held sacred by the Irish on account
of a certain bell favoured by St. Patrick. Perhaps the rivers Tiber and
Tiverone, as well as Tivoli, anc. _Tibur_, may come from this root.

[Sidenote: TON (A.S.),
TUN (Scand.),]

an enclosure, a town. The primary meaning of this word comes from
the Gothic _tains_, Scand. _teinn_, Ger. _zaun_, a fence or hedge
formed of twigs. Originally it meant a place rudely fortified with
stakes, and was applied to single farm-steadings and manors, in which
sense _tun_ is still used in Iceland, and _toon_ in Scotland. The
word _toon_ retained this restricted meaning even in England in the
time of Wickliffe. These single enclosures became the nucleus of a
village which, gradually increasing, became a town or city, in the same
manner as villages and towns arose around the Celtic _duns_, _raths_,
and _lises_. This root, in the names of towns and villages, is more
common than any other in Anglo-Saxon topography, being an element
in an eighth part of the names of dwelling-places in the south of
Great Britain. The greatest number of these names is connected with
those of the original proprietors of the places, of which but a few
examples can be given here. In such cases, the root _ton_ is generally
preceded by _s_ or _ing_--_qu. v._; _e.g._ Grimston, Ormiston, Ribston,

Harold, and Felix); Canewdon (of Canute); Addlington and Edlington
(of the nobles); Dolphinton, Covington, and Thankerton, parishes in

[Sidenote: WALSCH (Ger.),

VLACH (Sclav.),]

foreign. These words were applied by the Teutonic and Sclavonic nations
to all foreigners, and to the countries inhabited or colonised by
those who did not come from a Teutonic stock or speak their language.
In the charters of the Scoto-Saxon kings the Celtic Picts of Cambria
and Strathclyde were called _Wallenses_; _e.g._ Wales, _Gwalia_--root
_gwal_ or _gall_, foreign. The Welsh call their own country _Cymru_
(the abode of the Kymry or aborigines)--(the home of the Cymric Celts),
so named by the Saxons; Wallachia (the strangers’ land, _vlach_), so

Walloons by their German neighbours; and Wlachowitz, in Moravia, means
the town of the Wallachs or strangers. The Gadhelic _gall_ (foreign),
although used with the same meaning as _wealh_, is not connected with
it. It is a word that has been applied to strangers by the Irish
from the remotest antiquity; and as it was applied by them to the
natives of Gaul (_Galli_), _gall_, in the first instance, might mean
simply a native of Gaul. It was afterwards used in reference to the
Norwegians, _Fionn-ghaill_ (the _fair_-haired strangers); and to the
Danes, _Dubh-ghaill_ (the _dark_-haired strangers); and in connection
with them and with the English the word enters largely into Irish
topography; _e.g._ Donegal, _i.e._ _Dun-nau-Gall_ (the fortress of
the foreigners or Danes); Clonegall and Clongall (the meadow of the
strangers); Ballynagall and Ballnagall (the town of the strangers,
or English). For the further elucidation of these words _v._ _Irish
Names of Places_, by Dr. Joyce, and _Words and Places_, by the Rev.
Isaac Taylor. The words _Gaill_ and _Gallda_ are applied by the

have no connection with the name which they apply to themselves--_The
Gaidheil_, derived from an ancestor _Gaodal_.

is unintelligible to their Sclavonic neighbours. The Wends in the
sixth century occupied the north-eastern parts of Germany, but are
now chiefly confined to Lusatia; _e.g._ Wendischbach (the Wends’
brook); Wendischhausen and Windsheim (the dwellings of the Wends);
Wendischgratz (the Wends’ fortress); Wendischkappel (the Wends’
chapel or church); Windecken and Wendischhayn (the Wends’ corner and

[Sidenote: WESTEN (Ger.),]

the west. This word Buttman traces to an old Ger. root _wesen_, Goth.
_visan_ (rest), _i.e._ the quarter of the heavens where the sun sinks
to rest; _e.g._ Westphalia (the western plain); Westerwald (west wood);
Westerufer (the western shore, _i.e._ of the R. Inn); Westhausen and
Westhoffen (the west dwellings and court), in Alsace; Wesen, on the

(western dwelling), so called to distinguish it from Ostra-aros (the
eastern dwelling); Westman’s Isles, Scand. _Vestmanna-eyar_, on the
coast of Iceland, so called because peopled by men from the west--Irish
pirates; Westbury, Westbourn, Weston, Westbrook, from the same root.

[Sidenote: WICH, WIC, WYK (Teut.),
WICK, VIG (Scand.),
WAS, WIES (Sclav.),]

a dwelling, a village, a town--a word in general use in the topography
of Great Britain, as well as on the continent, but with various
meanings. According to Leo, the Teut. _wich_ or _vichs_ arose from
the root _waes_, A.S., and _wiese_, Ger. (a moist meadow) and hence
was applied to places situated on low lands, often on the bank of
a stream; _e.g._ Meeswyk (the town on the Maas); Beverwyk, on the
Bever. The primary meaning seems to have been a station--with the
Anglo-Saxons a station or abode on the _land_, with the Norsemen a
station for _ships_. The root of the word runs through all the Aryan
languages--Sansc. _veça_, Grk. _oikos_, Pol. _wies_, Ir. _fieh_,
Cym.-Cel. _qwic_, all meaning an abode; _e.g._ Alnwick (the town on
the R. Alne); Ipswich, anc. _Gippenswich_, on the Gipping; York, A.S.
_Eorvic_, Lat. _Eboracum_, Welsh _Caer-Ebreuc_ (the town on the water,
or R. Eure); Hawick (the town on the haugh or low meadow); Noordwyk
(north town); Nederwyk (lower town); Zuidwyk and Zuick (south town),
in Holland and Belgium; Harwich (army town), so called from having
been a Saxon station or military depot; Keswick (the town of Cissa);
Wickware, in Gloucestershire (the town of the family of De la Ware).
On the other hand, the Scandinavian _wich_ or _vig_ signifies a bay,
or a place situated on the coast, or at the mouth of a river--thus
Schleswick (on a bay formed by the R. Schlie), in Prussia; Wick (the
town on the bay), in Caithness; Sandwich (the town on the sandy bay);
Lerwick (on the muddy bay); Greenwich, Scand. _Granvigen_ (the town on
the pine bay); Reikjavik, in Iceland (the reeky or smoky bay); Vigo
in Spain, and Vaage in Norway (on spacious bays); Swanage, in Dorset,
anc. _Swanwick_ (Sweyen’s bay town); Brodick, in Arran (the broad bay
town); Wicklow, in Ireland, probably Danish _Vigloe_ (bay shelter),
used by the Danes as a ship station; Smerwick (butter bay); Berwick,
contracted from _Aberwick_ (at the mouth of the R. Tweed)--_v._ ABER.
_Wiche_ also denotes a place where there are salt mines or springs, and
in this sense is probably connected with the Scand. _vig_, as salt was
often obtained by the evaporation of sea-water in shallow bays; thus
Nantwich--_v._ NANT; Middlewich (the middle salt works); Droitwich,
Lat. _Salinæ_ (the salt springs, where the _droit_ or tax was paid).
In some cases _wich_ or _wick_ is derived from the Lat. _vicus_,
cognate with the Grk. _oikos_ and Sansc. _veça_ (a dwelling)--thus
Katwyk-sur-mer and Katwyk-sur-Rhin are supposed to occupy the site
of the Roman _Vicus-Cattorum_ (the dwelling-place of the Chatti);
Vick or Vique, in Spain, from _Vicus-Ausoniensis_ (the dwelling of
the Ausones); Vidauban, in France, from _Vicus-Albanus_ (the dwelling
of Albanus); Longwy, from _Longus-vicus_ (long town); Limoges, anc.
_Lemovicum_ (the town of the Lemovici); also in France: Vic-desprès
(the town on the meadows); Vic-sur-Losse and Vic-sur-Aisne, the towns
on these rivers. The Sclav. _wice_ is found in Jazlowice (the town on
the marsh); and Malschwice (Matthew’s town), etc.

Lat. _Regni-sylva_ (the wood or forest of the _Regni_, a tribe);
Wittstock and Woodstock (woody place); but Wittingau, Wittingen,
Wittgenstein, Wittgensdorf, and other names with this prefix in
Germany, come from the patronymic _Wittick_ or _Wittikind_ (_i.e._ the
children of the woods). In England the same prefix may mean _white_,
as in Witney, or from places where the Saxon _Witangemote_ held their
meetings; Holywood, in Dumfriesshire, Lat. _Abbia sacra nemoris_ (the
abbey of the sacred wood), called by the Irish _Der-Congal_ (the sacred
oak grove of Congal).

   “Let it be said once and for all that the design and arrangement
   are excellent. The work makes no slight demands upon the
   author’s capacity for clear and sensible exposition. To such
   demands Mr. Lodge has proved himself fully equal, while it is
   not difficult to discover, scattered throughout the book, traces
   of higher qualities.”--_Saturday Review._

   “Mr. Lodge is to be congratulated on the excellence of his
   arrangement and on the discretion he has shown, both as regards
   the things he omits and those he insists on. While his pages
   abound in facts, he has not been content to give a mere crowded
   summary of events, he presents us with many sound and thoughtful
   remarks on the tendencies of each of his periods. His grasp
   is firm, and he never loses his way amidst a multitude of
   details.”--_Journal of Education._

“I feel strongly the great importance of the subject, not only as a

more especially necessary for Englishmen, many of whom will be called
upon in after life to turn their geographical knowledge to practical
and serious account.”--_One of the opinions of Head Master of English

“Modern geography has, up to quite a recent date, been almost entirely
neglected in many of our large schools, and where professedly taught
has, in too many instances, been made the most repulsive instead of the
most fascinating of studies. Such books must ever be not less welcome
to teacher than to pupil.”--_Standard._

   Post 8vo. 5s.

“After a careful examination, we are bound to say that it is the most
comprehensive, accurate, and methodical geography with which we are
familiar, and bears on every page unmistakable traces of careful and
industrious research. It fully sustains the high reputation of Mr.
Murray’s series of Manuals, and we venture to predict for it a wide
popularity. Bearing in mind its high character, it is a model of
cheapness.”--_School Guardian._

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project

    • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method

        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
