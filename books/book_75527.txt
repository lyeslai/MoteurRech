                                   I

    I sprang from the heart of the earth,
    From the brown, still heart
    That gives, though it pulseth not,
    All things being and birth.
    This vegetable mould,
    Black, resisting, and cold,
    Is pregnant in every part
    With essence of life.
    Infused with The Spark, my shell--
    Pained with the mighty swell
    Of being and life that woke--
    Travailed: fibres broke.
    Green shoots slender,
    Powerful, though most tender,
    Pushed upward--a crust gave way--
    Earth opened ... and I saw day!


                                  II

    Myriad forms
    Pure and new as a thought of God,
    Rose from the sod,
    Sprang into life with me,
    A bending sea
    Of distant, infinite blue,
    From East to West, from South to North,
    Bent over us. We, called forth
    Up from the heart of the earth,
    Shook in the east wind’s mirth,
    Thrilled to the south wind’s kiss.
    Rain and dew,
    Storm and sun,
    Blessed us, made us _this_,
    And we grew.


                                  III

    Oh days
    In early summer, when all things breathe
    With delight in being! Golden haze
    Covers valleys and distant heath.
    The wind, these times,
    Faints with its burden from Southern Climes
    Of odours, subtler than balm or myrrh.
    Then we stir
    And surge like fair seas to and fro.
    When through our green blades the light winds sweep,
    Between our thin stalks straight and tall,
    You may see, a-tremble, like flames that blow,
    The Scarlet Flowers of Sleep.
    Low down they grow,--
    Fine as a film,
    Red and soft as Love’s lips glow,
    Red as jewels the gods let fall.


                                  IV

    Oh days,
    When the sun, red through the haze,
    Burns bronze to gold!
    No breeze wakes,
    Sleek cows stand in orchard shade;
    And the little sound that ebb tide makes
    At the foot of the cliffs is low and sweet
    As sighs half-breathed, as lips that meet.
    In this ripening time
    We wait so still, that we scarce are stirred
    By the flight of a startled bird
    From its nest, in the furrows made.
    Summer’s power
    Changes our hue from royal green
    To golden, hour by hour.


                                   V

        Oh days
    Full of sweet noises! Songs of birds,
    And gentle sound of lowing herds.
    When all around--
    From farther fields and orchard trees--
    Comes the drowsy hum of bees.


                                  VI

        Bend the ear
    To our sibilant whispering!
    This is the full of the year.
    The Golden Mene, when the rich earth bears
    In plenty and fulness and mankind shares
    In the good of her,
        Oh hear, the wind wakes; and we sing!


                                  VII

        See the forms,
    Big and sturdy and strong and brown!
    The sinewy arms,
    The naked chest, where the shirt falls down,
    The blue veins swollen, the sweat of toil,
    The sweat of brow and the earth-cast look,
    The coarse shoes, red with the furrow’s toil,
    The knotted hands....
        The Field is the book
    These fingers turn, and these eyes pursue.
    The sudden hail, the deadly dew,
    The blight of the boll and the dry, parched days
    Are the lines that mark their tragedies!
        These are the Workers--!
    Their hands have made
    The great earth fertile from sea to sea.
        Silently
    They bend to their labour, knowing not
    What they shall reap that their hands have sown!
    “Man may not live by bread alone;”
    They ask but this, “and receive a stone!”


                                 VIII

    From the faint, gray dawn to the late night’s shade
    The open air is their dwelling-place.
    The sweetest and best that their lives have known
    Is the mild, soft air in the summer-time,
    When they learn the noon by the village chime
    And pause to rest for an hour’s space.


                                  IX

        Misery,
    Is in the hut for the worker there;
    What for his eyes to see?--
    Children, that dumbly ask for things
    He knows not of, nor they know who plead!
    More than a garment for nakedness,
    Or warmth from woe that the winter brings,
    Or bread--that, God! is a want indeed!


                                   X

        “Life for life,” the Prophet says,
    The fulness of days shall come and the reapers reap.
    The white blade seethes like a wind, and we
    Tremble at death in the blade’s cold kiss.
        Distant, infinite blue
    From East to West, from South to North,
    Bends over us.
        We, called forth
    Up from the heart of the earth,
    Mother that gave us birth,
    Lie on her heart again.
        Sun and dew,
        Wind and rain,
            Pass over us.


                                  XI

        On the bare, brown land,
    In level, close-bound sheaves, we stand;
    And this is the end,
    Till the fine, dry film from the blade’s unfurled
    And we go forth,
    From East to West, from South to North
        Bread--for the world.




                      IN THE JOINT OF HIS ARMOUR


                                   I

    Then said the king:--“Stand here, Sir Guldemar,
    Beside me, where the arras falleth close.
    Now, down this marble stair the princess goes.
    And thou shalt mark her, hidden here with me:--
    And thou shalt tell me, on thine honour’s oath,
    If any woman is as fair as she.
    (Giving thy guerdon, no fear hanging loath!”)


                                  II

    “For, when thou sayest,--‘_She’s_ more fair
    Than the queen’s sister!’--straight that woman shall,
    Guldemar, to thy have and hold befall.
    The hour thou didst so knightly lift thy lance
    To shield our life, we gave our royal word--
    For Guldemar! the fairest in all France!” ...
    (Guldemar stood beside his king and heard.)


                                  III

    He held his head-gear downward in his hands;
    The white plume kissed along the gleaming steel
    Of his gray armour, close from head to heel.
    High around his throat’s column, lay the fine,
    Steel, tinkling little links, that rose and fell
    To mark his breath. (Nor did the king divine
    The hot heart beating in the mailèd shell!)


                                  IV

    “To women he is as the heart of ice,”
    The women laughed: and held it for a wage
    That none could Baron Guldemar engage
    In sport of love, or earnest: his straight gaze
    Was like the falcon’s on the hand held high,
    Above the hunter and the under-maze,
    Toward a goal cloud hidden in the sky.


                                   V

    “The king” (he said) “is as God’s bread,--above
    The hope of any save the lips absolved:
    Yet my lips touch his garment! If involved
    My heart, Sire, can I find another fair
    But her I love? Even though the king’s sister
    Were born of Venus? My liege lord must spare
    My finding any beauty like to _Her_.”


                                  VI

    And the king smiled as one in kindly wise
    Surprising a dear secret. “Friend,” (he said,)
    “Fear not to say thy ladye’s lips are red
    And her eyes heaven! We demand the truth
    From a brave knight, who knows not how to lie!
    He shall wed but perfection, by God’s Ruth,
    Whose voice cried,--‘I, and not the king, shall die!’”


                                  VII

    (And Guldemar) “My liege,” (here his head bowed,)
    “Or the king’s sister, or the fairer she,
    That woman, my dear lord will give to me?” ...
    “By the cross!” swore the monarch; “though she prove
    Ice! Though her hate thy passion’s warmth excels.”
    Said Guldemar: “_And if I have her love?_”
    The king: “Ourself shall ring the marriage bells.”


                                 VIII

    The knight had thrown his gauntlets to the ground.
    His silken sleeves clung down unto his wrists.
    The foremost in the wars and in the lists
    His breast blazed with the stars of victory.
    He wore a signet such as nobles wear;
    He wore, beneath his mail, where none could see,
    A bright chain woven of his ladye’s hair!


                                  IX

    “Hark!” said the king, “the princess comes! And hark,
    Those are her pages singing!” Guldemar,
    His soul high lifted, trembling like a star,
    Flashed his quick speech like light upon the king.
    “Sire, what if my life were wholly given
    To love a woman with a marriage ring?
    Her hell and mine, another’s rightful heaven!”


                                   X

    “The holy cross,” the king said, “and our word
    Are linkèd promise! This same night shall stir
    A great host for the holy sepulchre.
    The man who keeps thy souls and loves apart,--
    As a cursed spirit, banished from a shrine,
    Must bind the crusade cross upon his heart,
    And wind a pilgrim way from thee and thine.”


                                  XI

    Guldemar heard. There went a tinkling
    Like little heavenly bells, and soft singing,
    A pleasant smell like violet-woods in spring
    Was wafted from the princess’ silks astir.
    First came the mincing pages, finely dressed,
    Then walking all alone the king’s sister,
    And in her beauty one forgot the rest.


                                  XII

    And every knight and every troubadour
    Had given to Isobel great beauty’s palm.
    Only the queen her sister, pale and calm,
    Could claim a beauty near to Isobel’s.
    She came entrancing down the marble stair,
    Her glad wide eyes as blue as asphodels,
    And the imprisoned sunlight in her hair.


                                 XIII

    The king and knight the arras held apart.
    “Now by God’s rood,” the king cried, “if there is
    A fairer woman in my court than _this_,
    To-night thine arms clasp her,--or Isobel!”
    Guldemar bent his bright bold look serene,
    Upon his liege--and held his body well--
    “Sire,” he said, “one is more fair--the queen.”


                                  XIV

    The monarch dropped the arras and stood close,
    His eyes on Guldemar’s, and pride, and hate,--
    Sudden for love and gifts,--rode hot, elate.
    Guldemar’s sword and gloves lay on the floor.
    The king snapped his own sword in two, then pale
    Cursed Guldemar, ... who felt the chain he wore
    Prick him to fire beneath his coat of mail.


                                  XV


    Without, the stony courts rang with the feet
    Of steel-shod men, and horses’ clanging shoe.
    And yellow torches flashed their brilliance through
    Dim corridor, and winding way remote.
    High in the belfry rang a faint peal sweet,
    As silver bells spelt out a marriage note.
    The red cross blazed on breast and banner white.
    Shouted the warder at the castle moat--
    “To arms! The king rides to the wars to-night!”




                             LAURENS VILLA


    “There is no happiness!” I cried.
    “Hush, hush!” she laughed, lying by my side.
    “I think I am too blest! The gods
    Will smite me with their jealous rods
    Upon thy breast!”... “Sweetheart,” (she said,)
    “Art not content?” I hid my head
    In silence: whilst she laughed; all slow
    Saying,--“Oh, Love, since thou _must_ know!
    When Laurens died, thy sword that let
    His life out, with his red blood wet
    Let in the light to me!”... I turned
    And kissed her, till the fires burned
    In flame to Eros. And she slept
    Until the hushed white morning crept
    And with unprisoned sunlight came
    To wake with matin sword of flame.

    Half sleeping, I essayed to find
    Her lips: and with warm hands to bind
    Her fast with her bright hair; then watch
    The mellowing of the eaves and thatch
    Under the morning.... She was cold.
    I clasped within my trembling hold
    Beauty’s bright lamp extinguishèd!
    Her lily limbs and flower head
    Were as the unsunned dawn is cold,
    And white as was the pleated heavy fold
    Of her close-clinging linen gown.
    Her eyelids safely folded down
    Over the azure shining thro’
    That mocked the heavenly sky, with blue!
    The fine red lip-line parted, showing
    Her small white teeth; and golden, glowing
    The splendid masses of her hair
    Wantoned their glory everywhere!
    Smiling she lay, her arms thrown wide
    As she would clasp on every side
    Happiness...! This when morning came
    To wake us with its sword of flame!

    God knoweth how I listened, close
    To her lips’ lovely parting rose,
    Lest one fine breath should stir ... and bid
    The uplifting of a heavy lid,
    Or wake again that silent heart
    Whence fell the linen folds apart ...
    Under the pulseless hills of snow
    Where strayed the blue veins to and fro
    No breath should ever stir again!
    And then my grief broke forth like rain.
    Rang through the tomb-like house and shook
    The white doves in their rose-vine nook.
    None else to pain or grieve was there
    In the still villa anywhere.
    I lay until the dying day
    Pale as my cheeks, and cold and grey,
    Stole mourning o’er the horizon.
    And then, I feared to stay alone
    With Germaine, who lay there and smiled
    So still and gladly as a child
    In first sleep, whilst my tears had made
    Rivers upon her breast and head
    And she cared nothing! So I took
    My cloak and garment, from the hook
    Where hung her clothes. I wept, again
    Touching and kissing them. “Germaine!”
    I cried, and summoned thus the dead.
    I took the linen off the bed
    And laid one line of winding shroud
    Over my love: and weeping loud
    I looked where she lay smiling, glad,
    From head to feet, twilight yclad,
    Then I crept out--a grey old man.

           *       *       *       *       *

    They hold me under curse and ban,
    I “killed this woman as she lay
    In my embrace!” This thing they say!
    But Germaine, could she speak, would still
    Their lisping lies...!
                          “If love can kill”
    (Germaine would tell them) “why then he
    Killed me, forsooth, with loving me....”

    Little it matters! I shall sleep
    In sleep like hers; but not so deep,
    _For love was earth’s last gift to her_!
    The little cotton dress she wore
    With ribbons, hangs against the door ...
    In the white villa, ... still it is!...
    Only the doves were witnesses.




                               THE HOST


    I had my enemy within my house.
      My enemy--my arch, arch enemy.
    I bound my handkerchief about his brows,
      For he was wan and cried--“A Boon!” to me.

    Standing upon the threshold--wan, distraught,
      His eyes filmed with the mist of sickness dim;
    “He does not know it is my house!” (I thought)
      “_Salve!_” I cried, and ran to welcome him.

    He could not see nor hear; I spread my bed,
      Thereon I made him lie all weakly down.
    Blood ran into his eyes, from his rent head
      Cut deep between the eyebrow and the crown.

    Quickly I ministered what grace I could:
      Washed out the wound and bound it up with care;
    Smoothing his kerchief as his mother would;
      Laying my fingers gently through his hair.

    From out my store I fetched a brimming cup
      Of fragrant wine, and held it to his lip,
    Lifting all tenderly his hurt head up.
      Lest he should know me,--let the curtain slip

    Between our faces. Long he drank, and deep,
      And muttered thanks to God, and stretched out wide
    His great form on my bed, thus fell asleep
      Safe as the child his mother guards beside.

    And there, within my walls, he lay at last,
      My enemy--my arch, arch enemy!
    I let my crimson passion loose, and cast
      Curses for all the wrongs he’d done to me.

    Crouching low at the bedfoot, still, oh, still
      As Fate relentless, long I watched him lie
    Curtained within the shadows red, until
      He seemed to lie there murdered bloodily.

    Like deadly grave-robed figures, one by one,
      A cold procession passed before my gaze,
    The high bold-handed evils he had done
      To me, to mine, the ruin of our days.

    I felt my hand close on my unsheathed sword--
      “The prayers of all your yesterdays” (I cried)
    “Must gain you pardon of the gracious Lord!”
      And he, unshriven, by my hot hate had died--

    Had I not heard wild cries without my door,
      The acclamations of the multitude.
    My enemy stirred not in his stupor
      I drew the bedshades close, and waiting stood.

    Then they were all about me in the place,
      Strange, furious faces, peering everywhere
    Seeking the hated stranger, whose foul trace
      Had left their village desolate as here.

    “Show us Pasquale, show the devil hound,”
      And twenty eyes flashed sharper than the blade.
    They shrieked his name until I thought no swound
      Was proof against the riot that they made.

    I saw the naked unsheathed swords, I saw
      (My enemy--my arch, arch enemy!)
    Minions of justice, armed with hate and Law
      And my guest was asleep.... “Myself am he”

    (I said before the swords their home could find).
      “Draw me without,” I prayed, “I would not fall
    Here where my children sleep.” And they were kind
      And dragged me far without my own portal.

    Ere they could send my soul to hell unshriven
      Pasquale’s men came riding bright as day
    More time new sins to make, to cry to heaven,
      They bought Pasquale ... I write as I lay.

    They say I shall not see another dawn
    But I have had the sacred Eucharist
    And write this for true knights to dream upon.

    _That day of his sore need, with broken brows
    And sightless eyes blinded with bloody mist
    Helpless, whilst his pursuers hounded on
    I had my enemy within my house._




                               THE PAGAN


                                   I

    Oh the dream,
          Warm, wild, beautiful,--born of midsummer.
          No, it was April gave it; no, it was May!
          It was the whole round year,
          Days, months, filled with it,
          Hours Eden inspired.
          Moments astral born,
                Life
          Fused, swathed, held in its mystery,
                Perfect content in the present,
                Ecstasy at the thought of a future.
                Oh the dream....
                Hush, I will sing of it....


                                  II

    I was a child, knee-deep in the rugged daisies;
    Small head level with bright bold heads tossed free.
    Brown eyes following farm and meadow mazes:
    Little heart one with nature, flower, and tree;
    Friend with the birds.... Then childhood passed, on a sudden as pure dawn’s haze is
            Kissed to glorious morning, and all eyes see,
    Standing young as the June, little heart’s pulse set free
    Throbbed to the song that the soul of the whole world’s lays is:--
    A child in the home-land meadows,
                    Belovèd, I dreamed of thee.


                                  III

    Once I walked in the heather,
    Cliffs sheer downward touched the breast of the sea.
    Meadows ’round me stretched and kissed together,
    Met in oceans of gold grain feather
    Mad with poppies, red as blood may be.
    Summer’s glory to glory ran;--nor sense knew whether
    It were godliest born, the blue of the sea
    Or the whispering ocean of fields, as shoreless!
                          Then the tether
    Of time slipped loose, and Future showed to me,
    Cliff-high,--sea-girt,--there in the Norman weather
    All of my youth Belovèd,
                                I dreamed of thee.


                                  IV

    It was in the heart of winter cold,
    When the moon is old,
    And snow on the lea.
    I leaned from my window
    And heard the sea
    Ring like brass, when deep is tolled
    The _bourdon_ of Christ’s nativity.
    The Christmas world its page unrolled
    For my pagan eyes to see.
          Sheep held close in their sparkling fold,
          And the ice-mailed tree
          Glistened, ... as tho’ God leaned, and set
          Crystal tapers, with diamond fret;
          A holy festal tree made it,
          Whose candles the moon lit!
    I smelled frankincense, from censers gold
    Shadow-swung to a litany
                              Glorious!...

    Then wild, and bold,
    A Christmas storm swept over me.
    I leaned out from my parapet,
    Cliff-high tower, that keeps the sea:--
    Arms and breast on the sill icy,
    Warm arms aching to clasp and fold
    One who close on my breast should be!

    Pagan, thus in the Night Holy,
    Breaking form of the ancient mould,
    I saw God’s one star poise, and swim
    Over the birth of Love, in Him,
    But Belovèd ... I dreamed of thee.

    You sang me a song,
        ’Twas the close of the year,
    Sing again!
    I do not remember the name
        Or the words,
    ’Tis the same
        You listen to hear
    When the window is open in spring
        And the air’s full of birds;
    One calls from the branch some rare thing
    And one sings on the wing
        The refrain.

    You sang me a song,
        My heart thrilled to hear.
    The refrain
    Has run like a fillet of gold
        Through the woof
    Of the cold,
        Dark days of this year.
    To-night there’s a year at its start,
        The birds are aloof:
    But your eyes hold the sun for my part
    And the Spring’s in your heart,
        Sing again!




                             FOREST LOVERS


    Of poplar, birch, and balsam boughs,
    Red cedar-walled, I’ll build my house;
    Its pillars silver-boled shall be,
    With rafters of the hemlock tree;
    Upon the ground the dried ferns spread,
    And slippery pine shall make our bed;

    And all night long the lapping sound
    Of waves shall fill our faerie swound;
    Nor native creatures, small and shy,
    Shall fright us, as they hurry by,
    Nor phantom rustle of the trees
    Disturb our loving mysteries.

    With the first flying birds to nest
    We’ll stretch our happy limbs to rest,
    And lip to lip, and palm to palm,
    Drift dreamward in the deep wood’s calm,
    Whilst thro’ the windy rafter bars
    Pale out the lanterns of the stars.

    Thus love shall hold us (as Love said),
    And holy be the forest bed,
    The fresh, wild odours everywhere
    Rise on the censers of the air,
    And in the soft dark Love shall find
    New vows, our lips and souls to bind.

    When the white-vestured dawn shall move,
    We’ll wake, as we have slept--with love,
    And sinless as the forest-born
    Arise with them to greet the morn.

    From every mist-grey tree-top tall
    The singing, singing dews that fall
    Shall mingle thro’ veiled vistas dim
    With whisper of our marriage hymn.




                        LIKE TO A SONGLESS BIRD


    Like to a songless bird that swings
        On a high branch, and thrills to hear
    How the deep-hearted forest rings
        With melody enchanting clear,

    And vainly swells his throat to wake
        A song as pure as these that fill
    The wood, and every echo shake,
        Whilst he alone is dumb and still.

    So, thrilling to the music dear
        Since the first song woke, low and sweet;
    To purest sound I bend my ear,
        And with my heart the rhythms beat;

    Until the palpitating Past
        With melody becometh rife;
    With parted lips and hands locked fast
        I hear the songs of Love and Life.

    And then I lift my voice to wake
        A song as pure as these that thrill
    Through Time. The vaults with music shake
        And I alone am dumb and still.




                             THREE YEARS!


    I heard the wind in the trees
        The stir of the leaves in the white birch tops
    Then sat alone with my past till dawn
        Crept over the edge of the leas
    And a dull red line was drawn
        In the East. There memory stops.

    We do not follow our lives
        As the almanacs run. I lived that night
    Three years in the past and three to be....
        As foam that the sea-wind drives
    My thoughts sped on--three years and three,
        Marked by this lock of white.




                      THE WIND UPON A SUMMER DAY


    The wind upon a summer day
    How sweet it is! The shaking trees,
    The shifting shadows as they lie
    Across the grass, the bending rye,
    The blue flowers in the grain,--and you
    To love the livelong summer through--
    There are no sweeter things than these.

    The dawning of a winter day
    How sad it is! The leafless trees,
    The frozen meadow lands that lie
    Leaden beneath a snowy sky;
    The old year’s bitterness,--and you
    To lack the livelong winter through--
    There are no sadder things than these.




                         ON THE NORMAN CLIFFS


    The summer fields sweep to the farther blue
    Crimson with poppies, yellow gold with grain.
    They roll their warm wealth seaward--thus to you
    I bring my boundless love. Dearest, in vain
    Would I bestow its treasure otherwhere;
    It floods to find your heart--enfold it there!

    The land’s caress the far seas never knew;
    Not on the wave falls the sweet rain of gold.
    Far lie the changeful waters, pure and cold,
    Sundered by the high cliffs: thus I from you
    By Fate am kept a universe apart.
    And yet my constant thought inspires me
    To seek to lay my love upon your heart.




                              MID-WINTER


    On this midwinter afternoon,
    When all the sky is cold and grey,
    What power can change the white world’s rune
        To a midsummer holiday?

    The branches of the leafless trees,
    Bent in the pathway of the storm,
    Give up their buds to orchard bees,
        The atmosphere is soft and warm.

    And from a thousand rose-hearts, too,
    The air delicious fragrance yields;
    The birds fly up against the blue,
        The Summer ripens on the fields.

    Thou art with me! This happy thought,
    That all the birds of love unchains
    To the white world, has Summer brought
        Through warmth of Summer in my veins.




                             MARE PLACIDO


    Across the tossing tumult of my sea
    The peaceful current of your Spirit flows.
    The ships attain their harbours, enter free
    Beyond the pale horizon’s line of rose.
        Tempests are banished from these miles serene:
    Held cloud-free, wind-free, by your love’s control,
    My sea shall yield its deep-bed treasure soon!
    Mirror the evening star,--the cloud,--the moon:
    Tranquil, as tho’ no storm had ever been--
        My sea shall be the mirror of your soul.




                           IN THE GREENWOOD


        I fly like a bird to my home that lies
    Far in the west, by a fair green hollow.
    The straight, fine, meadow-line runs with the skies:
    A clear horizon for sight to follow,
    To leave, then rest where the zenith’s blue,
        Blue of the bluest, like my love’s eyes!

        I leave the noise of the busy mart;
    The small stream’s mouth with its shining shallows;
    I go with its going; till here, apart,
    Hid by rushes and low white mallows,
    Hushed in its singing it lieth deep--
        Deep of the deepest, like my love’s heart!

        I will sleep and dream while the shadows move
    And the slant of the sunlight falleth yellow.
    I will wake to the note of the greenwood dove
    As it calleth low to its distant fellow:--
    Where life of the fields and the woods is pure,
        Pure of the purest, like my love’s love!




                             EVENING TIME


    To-night I watch the sun go down,
    Blood-red it sinks behind the hills.
    The deep low-lying valleys brown,
    The wheat fields, and the daisied down,
    The bright, mist-shrouded radiance fills.

    Across the surface of the pond
    The small trees throw their dark shadows:
    Whilst in the outlying wood beyond
    The deeper darkness broods and grows.

    The day is no awakener
    To greater beauty, than day’s wane.
    The little leaves that move and stir
    Make noise as of the sound of rain.

    The very air is gone to rest,
    And long and black the shadows lie,
    As over all the crimson west
    The darkness follows up the sky.

           *       *       *       *       *
    Good-night!--until the sun shall send
    Along the east a shining mark!
    In answer to my greeting, Friend,
    You seem to call across the dark.




                             IN THE WINDOW


    Oh ... my love comes to me to-night,
        After the weary days.
    And I must trim the candle bright
        And light a cheerful blaze.

    Then close within the window stand,
        As down the silent streets
    My heart shall hear his coming, and
        How it knows, and beats!

    His footstep falls from stair to stair,
        (Oh my love is my own!)
    I wear a ribbon in my hair
        That only he has known.

    His kiss upon my palms he left;
        I hold its message, still.
    Long days have made his soul bereft,
        To-night ... he takes his fill!

    In winter-time, in summer too,
        In sunshine, and in rain.
    Love waits for love, the wide world thro’.
        (Alas ... for watches vain!)

    As in my window, hid I stand;
        (Would all so blest might be!)
    His step is on the threshold, and
        My love has come to me.




                               THE GLASS


    When I am old! Oh Love, who well can say
    Whether within a year, a month, a day
    Or six times ten years that dead time shall come
    When Hope is pale and wan Desire stands dumb,
    And Love though living, clasps with fingers cold,
                When we are old.

    I think, perhaps, that Boundary’s dim outline
    Will not be crossed by these swift steps of mine,
    But while Desire is warm, and Hope still thrills
    I shall go hence and look from unseen hills
    On mighty scrolls of centuries unrolled,
                I still not old.

    To Be: unpierced by Vision. Break the Glass!
    But if fourscore and ten my years should pass,
    Witness, dear eyes! Mine, looking back, shall see
    Towers of strength, and Peaceful Seas, and Thee,
    And Love, a fragrant cerement, my heart shall fold
                When I am old.




                          THREE DAYS MORE....


    Not love’s command
    Could dry one league of sea;
    Or even God’s hand
    Fold up one mile of land,
                  To bring you sooner unto me!

    There are but three more days to climb--
    To-day, to-morrow, and its mate,
    Till that day!... Did love know to wait
    Would it be love? Not in my time
    Or in my blood!
    My thought, elate,
    Swells like a rising sea to flood
    Covering barren days between
    And brings you (as love should)
    Till you stand there--my lord, my light, my good!...
    Ere the frail screen
    Of fancy falls to my embrace
    Sudden, the spell snaps short to Fate!
    Till that day--when I see your face--
    There are still three dark days to climb,
                    To-day, to-morrow, and its mate.




                            LOVE’S PARADOX


        I love you more with every rising day
    With every waning sun I love you more.
    Love walketh with me on the outward way,
    It stands to meet me at the open door.
    It singeth low when other sounds clash loud;
    It keeps me lonely ’mid a changing crowd.

        I love you most when I am far away;
    I love you most when on your heart I rest;
    I love you most when rapture has its sway,
    I love you in your still caresses best.
    In restfulness, or when your pulses beat--
    All times, forever, most I love you, Sweet!




                              VITA, VITA!


    The flight of the years pursues me.
            And nothing is done!
    Nor gained, nor made, nor accomplished--
            Only Youth--lost.
    Slave to the pleasure that fetters, (nor would be free,)
    Tired of the light before the disk of the sun
    Is more than half of a circle!
            Stunned at the cost
    Of full free living, and nothing wherewith to pay
    The long close score that blights with its fearful truth--
            _But my Youth_.




                               THE SLEEP


          Love in a life and after life--_the Sleep_!
    And we hang on a word, a look, and keep
    The pulses throbbing,--make the Spark burn low,--
    And close the Book, to laugh perhaps, to weep
    Most surely! if, oh gods! we may but know
          Love in life!

    Our burning hands we raise
    For dear palms’ clasp, and kisses on the lips,
    And close embrace.
    We give our nights and days,
    In the one draught delectable our spirits steep,
    Forgetting--(whilst the lights of Love eclipse--)
          _The Sleep_.




                              THE REWARD


    I heard the little cricket cry
    Last night in the dull rain--as I
    Put on my dark, my sombre dress.
          (I had no ear for happiness!)

    And as I braided up my hair
    I saw the white threads, silvered there,
    And on my cheeks the mark of tears,
    My only kisses thro’ the years.

    Sudden--that little voice I heard--
    Finer than call of cheerful bird.
    A human--tender--crying sound
    In the low grasses near the ground.

    Just as I said:--“_I will take Cheer
    Instead of Joy!_”--Your footsteps, Dear,
    Fell on the garden walk ... and when
    I put my candle out,--.... Again

    Late in the night I heard it plain
    The cricket, singing in the rain.




                             LES REVENANTS


    My only light is candle-light
          From candles fitly set
    In sconces, dazzling.
    Long threads, half melting, cling
    To snowy candle-masts, and fret
    The straight, slim forms, and I shall sit
    Alone, until the Spirit stirs
    These lily lights (for they are conjurers).
    From the high corners, shadows flit
    Across the floor: and One shall bring
    Back all my soul has loved and missed.
    And the dim others fade when we have kissed.
    But one remains, and I am one with it.

    My only light is candle-light
          From candles burning down
    Till each flame flickers into night.
    Is it the perfume slight
    From shadow hair and shadow gown
    Unseals my long-locked senses? Or,
    Light touching hands and lips that fill
    For me the waste of time, caress until
    I live as I have lived before?

    My only light shall be the candle’s light,
    To summon shades and mysteries
    Until my solitary spirit sees
    Your shadow steal across the shining floor.




                               THE BOON


        At break of day when shadows fly
    And still the earth is white with dew,
    When light soft mists on hillside lie
    And, stirring purple meadows thro’,
    The morning wind moves like a sigh,
    Oh I awake then quietly!
    Earth’s sullied things draw never nigh
    When thus the day from God is new
    And from a dim far place on high
    On the chaste line of day and night
    Where holy thoughts the souls imbue
    Who wake, praise God, keep pure, walk right
    A boon comes ... is’t not blest that I
    Walk thus thro’ fields of God with you
    At break of day when shadows fly?




                               THE SIGN


      Last night I felt your kisses on my face,
    Softer than April fall of wind-flowers;
    Sweeter than summer rain upon the grass;
    Sweeter than the light wind, that in the South
    Wakes, and in groves of myrrh and cassia stirs.
    I bent with parted lips to kiss your mouth--
    Straightway there fell a fine thin veil between.
    There stood the trees in level rows,
    The sunlight filled the trembling green
    Of the leaf-sea, in the fair close.

      By these straight boles, under these slender boughs,
    Throughout the days of midsummer, I stand
    Until God part the veil with shining hand
    And show me where you sit within His house
    Holding the seven-sparred star, whose name is Love.
    The time, though long, I know comes fast apace
    Because of the sweet sign you told’st me of,--
      _Last night I felt your kisses on my face_.

                             THE FIRESIDE


    Bitter cold the winter street,
        Cold and grey the sky:
    Bitter cold the veil of sleet
        The winds drive by.

    Warm and bright the fireside,
        Red the flames with cheer;
    What can winter’s woe betide
                            Us, Dear?

    On my hand I feel your palm
        As a bird lie warm:
    Oh the fireside is calm!
        It hears no storm.

    Bleak the winter street and cold;
        Red the flames with cheer;
    Love and firelight enfold
                            Us, Dear.




                          LOVE--WHERE YOU GO!


    Love, where you go December’s air grows warm,
      Birds bend the barren branches to their song
    And flowers spring, your coming steps to charm.
      Bursting the band of ice, and frosty thong.
      Over the highways prisoned in by snow
      They fling a garden in old winter’s scorn!
        Saying, “The lovely spring is here ... we know!”
        The sombre heart of midnight pales to morn
                            Love--
                                  where
                                        you
                                            go.--

    Love, where you go, grows my heart glad enow,
    My being’s pulse is tune with ecstasy.
    I find a ballad on each bending bough.
    I take my lute from off the greenwood tree
          To wake the dearest melody I know.
          I’ll fling my songs broadcast, to heaven’s blue
          Where the stars think your eyes are stars below....
          My soul finds its one paradise with you--
                              Love--
                                    where
                                          you
                                              go.




                          COSTANZA SINGS....


    My Love is a rider! (and life’s at its pace!)
        He rides to the battle--he rides to the chase.
    His armour is burnished, his nodding plume’s curled.
        (And would I could follow him over the world!)

    Nor distance, nor danger can keep us apart.
        He comes with the shadows and lies on my heart.
    He’s gone when the midnight its pinions has furled.
        (And would I could follow him over the world!)

    I’d gladly arise--don bonnet and sword,
        And follow the steps of my Love and my Lord.
    I’d stand by his side when the lances are hurled.
        (And would I could follow him over the world!)

        There his wanton wishes go!
    Spring, like flowers, to meet me straying....
                        I must pluck them--will, or no!
    I must break each pale stalk slender:
    I must lift each flower fair;
        For I know they are the tender
        Thoughts of love that greet me there....

    I will wear them on my bosom....
        In the night, when he comes home
    He shall see his thoughts in blossom,
        Oh Beloved Spring-time,
                            Come!




                              BRIER ROSE


    In among the tall weeds
    There lives a brier rose.
    Bright among the rugged reeds
    She bends and blooms and blows.
    The ragged bloom around her grows,
    And rough and rude her bed:
    But kisses of the wind she knows,
    And blushes warm and red.

    The sunny moor before her lies
    The stream runs bright and clear.
    She does not reck o’ sombre skies,
    Nor knows the changing year.
    She has no ken o’ winter drear,
    Nor dreads the frost and storm:
    For summer winds have called her _Dear_,
    She blushes red and warm.




                          THE SLEEPING HEART


    My heart is in the hawthorn tree.
    I left it in the lovely house,
    Hidden among the blooming boughs.
    And every little crimson rose,
    That blushes, reddens, pales or glows,
    Shall give its secret up to thee!
                My heart is in the hawthorn tree.

    My heart is in the hawthorn tree!
    It wears a fragile, rose-red dress:
    A robe of spring-time loveliness.
    It has forgot its songs to sing,
    And sleepeth like a tired thing,--
    To dream new songs, to sing to thee.--
                My heart is in the hawthorn-tree.




                                ABSENCE


    O darling--
        “My darling!”
    And this is all you say?
    And what are words of love and cheer
    When one is far away?
    O darling--
        “My darling!”
    A word is more than none
    And if you say what I would hear
    You’ll fill the world with sun
    O darling--
        “My darling!”




                               TO-MORROW


    Where is all the sunlight gone
        Dearest heart and dearest?
    Will it come again with dawn
        Dearest heart and dearest?
    Will it, stealing after night,
    Fold the waking hours, till bright
    To-morrow breaks the clearest,
    Best, of every day we’ve had
    Fresh and gay and good and glad?
        _Dearest heart--and dearest!_




                            OLD TIME MELODY


    I’m pining away for the way I’d go,
    I’m pining away for the things I’ve seen,
    For the joy of the fall of the first white snow,
    And the sweep of the forest green.

    But it’s not for the home-land, broad and fair;
    The house on the hill, or the old ways spread;--
    For why should I wander here or there,
    Since you went down to the dead?

    I’m pining away for the love you gave,
    For the world that you made, when your life lay here.
    And the path to the country beyond the grave
    Is the way that I pine for, dear!




                           THOUGH ALL BETRAY


    Dearest, give your love to me,--
      I will keep it well,
    Cradle it, as does the sea
      Hold the shell--
    Deep, unseen, and secretly.

    Dearest, give your kiss to me,--
      I will keep tho’ all assail:
    As the temple prayerfully
      Holds the Grail.
    Altars then my lips shall be!

    Dearest, give to me your trust,--
      I will not betray....
    Hold it, as the beacon must
      Hold the ray,
    Till the lighthouse stones are dust.




                            BREAK THY SLEEP


    When to-night, the shining snow
    Fell on forest brown and lea,
    Hanging diamonds on the tree;--
    When the dazzling world below
    Lifted up, all brilliantly,
    Stars again, to stars to throw;--
      Then I thought of thee...!
    White the winter forests sweep
    Down to meet the midnight sea,--
    Dearest, break thy charmèd sleep,
    Dream a winter dream of me.




                               RED ROSES


    The rose that comes on winter’s day
    It is the rarest rose--(they say)
    To venture forth so bright and bold,
    With velvet leaves and heart of gold,
      To wear so brave array:--
    Daring the icy atmosphere,
    Your winter roses, greet me--Dear
    And love, all warm amid the snows,
      Comes with the rose.

    As the days
        Go their ways;
    And the months, and the years,
    Bring their laughter and their tears,--
    And their range
        Of turn and change--
    All the old,
        Away we fold,--
        With the moth,
            And the dust;
        Nothing loth
            Since we must
    Have the new!
        As the days
            Go their ways
    One thing stays--
        My love for you.

                     (The White Elf Mother sings.)


    When the low flying wind, awake,
    Brushes the lilies, and the low
    Blue flowers hidden in the brake,--
    When the sighing Alders bend and shake,--

    When the owl’s whirring,--Hush thee, dear!
    For all the elfin lights aglow
    Will guide the slumber fairies here,
        Naught is stirring
        For my child to fear.

    When the strange sighing tree-tops sing,
    Dance all the fairies to and fro
    And white dreams from their mantles fling,
        While the flying
        Winds thy cradle swing.

    When the low crooning insects cry
    Creep the white elves soft, and slow,
    Hush thee, Sweet! and hear the merry
        Pipes a-tuning
        For thy lullaby!




                                FANTASY


    I hear the fluttering wind, I see
    The shadows on the grass.
    I wish that you would come to me!
    I would not let you pass!
    But springing up from where I lie,
    I take you in my arms, would I!
    I’d tell you where white heather grows,
    I’d kiss you, and I’d hold you close,
        I would not let you pass!

    Here, by my side, you’d watch with me
    Cloud shadows on the grass.
    If chance that you should come may be,
    I will not let you pass!
    Where the lost faerie kingdoms lie,
    I’ll tell in wonder-tales--will I!
    And as the brilliant fancy grows,
    I’ll kiss you, and I’ll hold you close,
        I will not let you pass!

    Take them, for they are doves with fluttering wing,--
    They try to reach your window: lift them higher--
    Up to your heart--there warm and nestling
    They shall find home, and life! If love aspire
    Shall it not speak? To voice a holy thing,
    To voice the heart’s deep need--the soul’s desire

    You came to me when I had turned and said:--

    My ways are in the stumbler’s paths instead!”
                            You came to me
    High and unprejudiced and spirit free.
    Wearing God’s seal upon your pure forehead,
    Dearest, you bent from your bright way to see
    My flickering torch: your own, live-flashing, red
    Rekindled the faint flame. Thus holily,
    A radiance, a light when light had fled,
                            You came to me.

    Go to the one by whom my soul is taught;
    Go--wing your joyous journey, nothing loth
    Like sunbeams in the hearts of lilies caught,

    Like perfume that eludes, yet lingereth;--
    Until your subtle mission’s fully wrought--
    To charm, as a dear dream’s pale image doth,--

    Its current running as a stream to sea,
    From hidden sources of my being brought,
                            Friend, unto thee.

    If the wise wonders of the world could be
    Found by a spell, sure my quick love had sought
    Each potent and elusive mystery.

    Into an amulet together wrought
    To charm thee! With this full confession free--

    Lacking love like this, too many wend
    Graveward. Highest heaven holds few
    Joys like this, with cruel pain to blend.

    I who know not Peace may feel its dew;
    I who have no prayers may kneel and bend
    In this gentle presence;--dear and new
                        Friend!

    Last night I heard in the wood green and still,
    The sweetest music sung by any bird.
    I never knew the soul of song, until
                      Last night I heard.

    Pure as life’s morning, warm as love first stirred,
    Fresh it outpoured our close attent to fill.
    Dearest, you were beside me, and your word
    Did through the heavenly harmonies distil
    The spirit’s joy: and grosser sense was blurred.
    I never knew the soul of Love, until--
                      Last night I heard!




                          GOD’S IS THE NIGHT


    Good night,--Love rules the world,--Sleep you!--
    There is no evil in Love’s sight.
    See how heaven’s lamps swing in the blue,--
                              Good night!
    Oh what avails the futile flight
    Of thought to bless the long dark through?
    _Deep is the darkness_, and, despite
    Of Love, our care is frail to do
    For those we love: but all is right,
    _God’s is the darkness_; friend, to you--
                              Good night!




                               CHRISTMAS


    Dearest ... for thee I make my Christmas song!
    A song of holly and of fragrant tree,
    Of festivals, that sweep their happy throng,
                                    Dearest, for thee!

    Look ... how the folding snow is on the lea;
    See the fine hoar frost lie the hedge along
    And the white holy stars shine mistily.
    A Christmas gift held high, though winds are strong,
    A warm and glowing gift, though ice may be,
    Comes star-blest, Christ-blest, over pain and wrong,
                                    Dearest, for thee!




                            LOVE’S UNIVERSE


    I find in thee fields, valleys, plains, and hills.
    Deep tender depths, a forest and a sea.
    All that the warm wide Earth with beauty fills
                            I find in thee.

    Each a small part of God’s fair world are we,
    Each one to a quick pulse of nature thrills
    Or mirrors in his soul a mystery.

    All sweetness that the summer wind distils,
    And all of winter beauty that may be,
    All that wakes ecstasy, or calms, or stills,
                            I find in thee!

    Golden flooding, till the whole world’s face is
                                  Sea and Sand.

    Far beyond our horizons, expand
    Happy bays--they say: but the wave’s race is
    _Toward_ our love-bound island, tempest-banned.
    Here for you and me the season’s grace is,
    Here the heart’s response, the touch of hand
    Make love’s universe, and Heaven’s embrace is
                                  Sea and Sand.

    Birds have left to storm and the wind’s tether
                                    Sand and Sea.

    Warm and bright those southern ports may be,
    Here, the ribald winter rules the weather
    Crying in the bending, tossing tree:

        We are two--sweetheart--and care not whether
        Summer reign, or Winter--so that we
        Live and love, as close as kiss together
                                    Sand and Sea.




                           AMOR IN EXCELSIS


    I love you so that I would rather have
    Your happiness than any joy below.
    I would give up my soul your soul to save,
                        I love you so!

    If round your island like sea should flow
    The dearest gifts men ever sought or gave--
    My heart’s desire should on the first crest glow!

    My love counts pain and death small things to brave;
    My love shall find the joy the immortals know;
    And triumph o’er the future--and the grave,--
                        I love you so!




                               THE ROSE


    Never again, Dearest, oh never more!
    Not in the spring-time’s swift enchanted reign,
    Shall hope to hope, shall love to love implore,
                                      Never again!

    Not in the summer--nor when autumn’s wane
    Blows the dry leaves along earth’s windy floor,
    Nor in the winter: that strange joy and pain

    No seasons’ circle ever can restore.
    The roses of to-day no tears shall stain,--
    They’re thornless! You shall see the rose you wore
                                      Never again!




                         WHERE ARE YOU, DEAR?


    Where are you, Dear, now that the winter white
    Has nearly run its course? Spring will be here
    And birds shall sing as home they wing their flight,
                      “Where are you, Dear?”

    Thus I have sung and waited thro’ the year,
    Saying at morning: “You will come with night?”
    And in the night: “With the dawn kind and clear,

    “You will pass by!” My little dwelling bright
    Has its soft curtains drawn; I wait the cheer
    Your presence brings by day and candle-light;
                      “Where are you, Dear?”




                     LA MORT EST TOUJOURS FIDÈLE!


    Gone!...
        And steal the shadows grey
    Where our window shone
    Late with lights; too soon are they
                    Gone.

    All that Heaven won
    When it took you, love, away
        My heaven’s built upon:--

    “Joy of life--Come back a day!”
        But the path leads on
        Through the night.... Grief wakes to say
                    “Gone!”




                               THE WATCH


    By candle-light when every fine flame played
    About your bed so long and cold and white,--
    I sat and kept my watch, and wept and prayed
                              By candle-light.

    Till memories a holy, holy flight
    Came back from our far childhood’s years, and stayed
    Touching us with their wings. And to thy bright

    High presence, “I will be all days” (I said)
    “A torch to hold thy spirit’s flame aright.”
    This was the tender promise that I made
                              By candle-light.




                            THE YEAR’S END


    What are my ways now that my Love is dead?
    As candles round a bier stand future days.
    Must I then read in annals of years fled
                  What are my ways?
    On, the Time-reaping shining sickle sways;
    I watch in fog and rain with bended head;
    And for no flower swathe the cold blade stays.
    If memory were a solace, hearts that bled
    Were healed long since!... Now the quick tear betrays
    I may not with my past be comforted:
                  What are my ways?




                              OUTRE MORT


    You came to me in visions of the night,
    Your pale brow bound by a bright ring of flame;
    High, unapproachable, and dazzling white,
                                You came.

    I rose and called you by your dearest name;--
    “Tell me,” I said, “how go the hours’ flight
    In that far land? Do men strive there for Fame

    And Love?” Then I lost sense and sight:
    You bent to me,--your kisses were the same
    As when, long since, to be my life’s delight
                                You came.




                               DEAD LOVE


    Dark the day when love is gone--
        When the vital spark
    Dies, and leaves the soul of one
                                  Dark.

    April for the birds shall hark.
        March’s wildness sown,
    June with crimson bloom shall mark.
    What has hope to build upon
    Cold and stiff and stark?
    All the future stretches on
                                  Dark.

    Cloud up my thought and tracery of my pen.
    Then would I burn the gentle candle-light
    Till, fading spectre, sank each tall mast white
    And cold stars lent their brilliant lanterns.... Then
    Should slumber only hold me till a dream

    Last night I seemed to see you standing, Sweet.
    Light mantled you from starry head to feet;
    Aureoles bound your brows, pale flame on Snows.
    Belovèd,--in your hand you held a Rose,
    No flower immortal, red as hearts that beat
    For earthly love, nor know the winding-sheet.
    Who loves, who has been loved, the Symbol knows!
    As you came toward me, with the Rose, royal,
    Faint heart took cheer;--cheeks wan with sullen grief
    Grew bright with thought of Bliss beyond the Veil.
    _Nirvana_ holds no lover’s heart in thrall.
    I wear the Rose, a kiss, each crimson leaf
    Warm with your lips.... Hail my Beloved!...

    “Eyes, lips, and benison of dearest hand,

    “Because so favoured the more cursed and banned?”
    I’d choose to lack thee! Ignorant, and blest
    Though love and thee were to have heaven possessed.
    Oh who would face the desolation’s sting
    Or choose to live bereft, with memory?

    I still may find after my Winter--Spring

    When they together saw the Calendar
    Slip by in months that wore Spring all days long,
    He made his lover’s verse and roundel song,
    The burthen of the rhyme his love of her!...
    What though the storm swept by with rainy stir,
    And winds, like ghosts, would ’round the windows throng,
    They sat heart-linked, hand-linked; and bright and strong
    Riot ran through their veins like Midsummer.
    For palm to palm is exquisite as May;
    And lip on lip is mad July at best!
    Where is the fire for this pale winter’s day?
    For one who sits alone at Death’s behest?
    Ghosts of the storm peer in with charnel mirth
    At ghosts of ashes on the gusty hearth.

    Masses and vespers, I must shun them all,
    Tho’ every belfry bid me to the feast!
    I may not wear the cross upon my breast;
    Nor make its sign;--or in repentance fall
    Before the nichèd saint. In canticle
    I must not chaunt one frail blurred note, or least.

    For my religion is my joy and shame;
    My priest, my altar, canticle, and mass
    Art thou! and lest thou hear my creed, and know;
    Shouldst hear me sing my love, or pray thy name--
    Unshriven with my burden I must go;
    Proud, excommunicate, I pagan pass!

    Trembling and silent; thus you could not know
    The vibrant, singing beauty, stealing slow,
    A sacred fire through my veins and blood.
    In the poor, songless, unawakened wood
    Of lute forgotten, who can guess the flow
    Of hidden harmonies to overthrow
    The heart and sense if one set free the flood?
    As the deaf master never hears the tone
    His genius wakes; so you, who make me sing,
    And all the pulses of my life control,
    Know but my silence, whilst for you alone
    Music and thought and song their concourse ring.
    Turn, then, and hear the love-song of my soul.




                              THE KINGDOM


    Behold I bring a Kingdom in my hand,
    Oh bend your eyes upon it!... Ways of peace
    Lead by its rivers. Fields of rest are these
    Above the endless skies of God expand.
    Oceans of dear delight kiss on the sand,
    And azure islands lift their waving trees
    Where virgin forests’ twined interstices
    Shadow the pools of sleep, deep inland seas!

    This is my lovely Kingdom.... Tho’ you reign
    Over an empire, proud, imperial,
    Annex this land of beauty to your part;
    Else, like a mirage, seen, then lost again
    It fade forever! Kingdoms vanish all--
    Immortal is the land of love, Sweetheart!




                             AMOR VICTRIX


    Strong Death, proud power invisible, even now
    Slowly thou drawest near me in the dark,--
    And though within me the clear glowing spark
    Of life is warm and beats in heart and brow,
    My body shall grow colder, till I bow,
    White as the ash, thine unresisting mark.
    But for the word from the veiled years I hark,--
    As calm and as invincible as Thou.
    And when at last I feel thy kisses,--Death,--
    My fading lips shall smiling tell thee this--
    “Master thou art not! On my Spirit’s shrine
    Deathless, although the altar crumbleth.
    Ascend twin flames in one,--to find God’s bliss,
    As God immortal,--my Love’s love and mine!”




                              SAINT OUEN


    Oh shrive my soul, Belovèd! Yesterday
    I placed two candles, straight and slim and fair
    Before a virgin’s altar, kneeling there
    For our united lives and love to pray.
    Around me the cathedral’s stillness lay;
    The mystery of God was everywhere;
    Lifting the misty aisles through incensed air
    Uprose the threading pillars, dim and grey.

    God heard my prayer: and He forgave my need,
    If after that day’s grace and majesty
    I fall and pay my sin with bitter cost;--
    You who have taught me prayer again, and creed,
    Bend down in dear forgiveness unto me!
    Shrive me, Belovèd! or my soul is lost.




                             RENUNCIATION


    I have not ever reached for Paradise;
    Nor sought beyond my fellows to be blessed.
    Nor hoped where all men fail;--but quick confessed
    The Limit, and the taunting Mark that flies.
    But since I’ve seen thy soul without disguise;
    And dreamed thy love’s great passion once expressed;
    I’ve known my portion’s good in one sole best:--
    Thy love and thee,--strong Spirit pure and wise!
    To read thro’ tortuous lines, at length to see
    What is the single goal, the heart’s desire,
    And then without possession learn to live,--
    Is Life...! Toward this, my chastened mind I give,
    And thro’ Renunciation dare aspire
    To reach God’s light, thro’ love and loss of thee.




                                 ENVOI


    A song of France in the autumn time,
        When rooks fly low, then go calling, calling
    That summer’s a thing of long ago,
    For the golden warmth you would never know,
    But the bronze-brown forests tell you so,
        And the leaves are falling, falling.

    The broad, bright river shines and flows
        In sweeps of blue; then goes singing, singing,
    Where borders of fern in crimson line
    Are aglow like flame in the late sunshine.
    In little slim poplars straight and fine,
        Mistletoe’s clinging, clinging.

    What matter after the sun goes down
        If chill creeps out from the forest’s hollow,
    Promising winter that earth affrays?
    Is not the course of the year always
    Toward spring,--and glory of golden days
        To follow, follow, follow?

    The light of the late year’s in my heart!
        It will not linger on death or dying.
    Like leaves of the forest, sere and gone,
    Are hopes of a future it once looked on;
    But Life and Love to goals to be won,
        Go flying, flying, flying.

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.

    • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    
    • You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
